abstract = {The essential oils of four medicinal plants belonging to Lamiaceae were explored for phytonematode control. The four oils inhibited (P < 0.05) nematode motility but Mentha spicata was generally more effective in reducing the numbers of active nematodes followed by Thymus vulgaris, Majorana hortensis and Mentha longifolia. The main corresponding compound of each oil, determined by GLC analysis, was carvone (58.14\%), P-cymene (40.5\%), terpinen-4-ol (41.6\%) and carvone (70.36\%). Soil stages of the reniform nematode were more affected by the oil than those of the ring and lance nematodes. When transferred to water, the total nematodes that regained their activeness ranged from 12\% for T. vulgaris to 60\% for M. longifolia. The four 0.1 oil solutions inhibited more than 80\% of Meloidogyne incognita-juvenile hatching compared to about 3.5\% at the control. The content of oxygenated compounds in these oils ranged from 45.79\% to 96.5\% and may be partially responsible for the nematicidal effects.},

Thyme was cultivated in rows of 50 cm apart with inter-row spacing of 15, 30 or 45 cm and was grown at various development stages. Plants were harvested during different growth stages including vegetation, beginning of blooming, full blooming and fruit maturation. Results indicated that oil yields of thyme were affected by growth stage and inter-row spacing. The maximum oil yields was obtained by harvesting at the early growth stage, which was found superior to oil yield corresponding to the later stages of collection. With 45 cm inter-row spacing, the maximum oil yield was recorded when the samples were collected at growth stage. Indicated results showed that the chemical composition during various growth stages was characterised by high percentage of carvacrol and its corresponding monoterpenic hydrocarbon precursors rho-cymene and gamma-terpinene, and ether 1,4-cineol.},

Desvaux, Centaurea pinnata Pau, Halopeplis amplexicaulis (Vahl.) Ung.-Sternb, Krascheninnikovia ceratoides (L.) Gueldenst, Lythrum flexuosum Lag., Microcnemum coralloides (Loscos \& Pardo) Buen, Pucinellia pungens (Pau) Paunero, Thymus loscosii Willk., and Vella pseudocytisus L. subsp. paui Gomez Campo, that grow in semiarid regions of NE Spain. In eight of these species, seeds collected from several (2-9) populations were tested. Constant 15 degreesC, 20 degreesC, or 25 degreesC, and alternating 15/25 degreesC temperature regimes and 16/8 hours light/dark photoperiod conditions were used. In seeds from the different populations of Halopeplis amplexicaulis and Microcnemum coralloides, manual scarification, dry heat, and soaking in gibberellic acid solution were used as pretreatments applied for enhancing germination. Germination variables recorded were final germination percentage and germination rate (T,,). Incubation temperatures had a significant effect on the final germination percentage in five species, while germination rate was differentially affected by temperature in only two species. Significant differences among populations under the same temperature were detected for both germination percentage and germination rate in most of the species studied. In general, both final germination percentage and germination rate of H. amplexicaulis and M. coralloides were increased by the pretreatments assayed. In these two species, the highest germination percentages were reached by manual scarification.},

The most suitable conditions for the extraction were 11 MPa and 50°C. The compounds extracted by both SFE and HD were identified by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The difference in the aroma of the products was quite noticeable and can be attributed to qualitative and quantitative differences in the extracts and hydrodistillates. Predominance of aromatic alcohols carvacrol and thymol and their biosynthetic precursors p-cymene and $\gamma$-terpinene was revealed in both SFE extracts and HD oil. The SFE extracts also contained water and cuticular waxes; longer extraction times and higher pressures resulted in a higher percentage of water and waxes in the extract.},

abstract = {Secondary compounds play multiple ecological roles. In this study, we present novel experimental evidence of differential tolerance to freezing temperatures among chemotypes of a chemically polymorphic plant, Thymus vulgaris. Non-phenolic chemotypes showed a significantly better survival and re-growth after early-winter freezing (-10 degrees in early December) than phenolic chemotypes. Comparison of temperature data (1971-2002) at a phenolic and non-phenolic site showed that whereas early-winter freezing occurred in 6 years in the non-phenolic site they never occurred at the phenolic site. Observations of trichome morphology (where the essential oil is stocked) with and without intense freezing indicate that non-phenolic chemotypes may escape any negative effects of freezing by releasing their essential oil into the atmosphere during severe freezing. The correlation between tolerance of freezing and local temperature regimes strongly suggests that differential freezing resistance is a key ingredient of the distribution of thyme chemotypes in space.},

The study of the physiological role of natural products in biochemical interactions among plants can supply new active compounds and/or models for new mechanisms of action. Volatile terpenes and essential oils have been reported as regulators of germination and growth of other species in several ecosystem. In this study we have carried out a chemical and biological evaluation of the essential oils from eight Mediterranean Labiatae in order to characterize their composition and to verify their potential activities in vitro on growth and development of three test seeds. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation from Hyssopus officinalis L., Lavandula angustifolia Miller, Majorana hortensis L., Melissa officinalis L., Ocimum basilicum L., Origanum vulgare L., Salvia officinalis L., and Thymus vulgaris L. and their chemical composition was achieved by GC and GC/MS methods. The essential oils have been assayed against the germination and the successive radical growth of Raphanus sativus L., Lactuca sativa L. and Lepidium sativum L. The assayed essential oils have shown a good inhibitory avctivity in a dose-dependent way, both on germination and radical elongation of three test species. Our study has shown a positive correlation between the total monoterpene content in the essential oils and the inhibitory activity.},

abstract = {Thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) is member of Lamiaceae family, which distributes in different areas of Meditranea and Asia. Thyme volatile phenolic oil has been reported to be among the top 10 essential oils, showing antibacterial, antimycotic, antioxidative, natural food preservative, and mammalian age delaying properties. It has been known that agronomical factors have a great effect on both quality and quantity of essential metabolites. For this reason, it is necessary to determine optimum levels of agronomical factors affecting plant growth and production. Planting space and time of harvesting are the most important agronomical factors. This study has been conducted in Research farm of ACECR, Institute of Medicinal Plants \& Natural Products Research along 1999-2000 on the base of factorial experiment in randomized complete block design with three replications. Thyme is cultivated in rows of 50 cm apart with inter-row spacing of 15, 30 or 45 cm. Plants are harvested in three stages, i.e. the beginning of blooming, full blooming and fruit set. In order to study the effects of plants space and time of harvesting, plant height, plant diameter, yields of dry and fresh herbage, content (\%) and yield of oil, thymol and carvacrol were measured. Planting space had significant effect on plant diameter (P < 0.05) and very significant effect (P < 0.01) on other measured parameters except oil content, which was not significant. Time of harvest had significant effect on yield of fresh herbage, content of oil and content of carvacrol (P < 0.05). Its effect on other parameters was very significant (P < 0.01) except dry herbage and oil yield. The maximum yield of dry and fresh herbage, yield and content of oil and thymol yield were obtained in 15 cm space and beginning of blooming stage. Maximum thymol content was observed in the beginning of blooming and 45 cm space. However, 15 cm spacing and harvesting in the beginning of blooming was the best treatment in respect of yield of dry matter, oil and thymol per unit area. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Although the subfamily Nepetoideae (Lamiaceae) is considered to be monophyletic, relationships between tribes, subtribes and genera within the subfamily are poorly understood as complex and possibly homoplasious morphological characters make taxa difficult to delimit. DNA sequence data from three regions (chloroplast: trnK intron; trnL-F; nuclear: ITS) in total including 278 accessions, representing 38 out of 40 genera of subtribe Menthinae and 11 outgroup genera, were used to reconstruct the evolutionary history, test previous hypotheses of classification, explain biogeographic patterns and elucidate character evolution. Using maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian analysis phylogenetic reconstructions based on nuclear and chloroplast sequence data were incongruent, consequently the data were analyzed separately. Both nuclear and chloroplast datasets provide strong support for three major lineages: the "Satureja", "Micromeria" and "Clinopodium" group. The first contains members of Satureja and Gontscharovia. In the second lineage Micromeria s.str. and Origanum were resolved as monophyletic, Pentapleura and Zataria indicated as sister groups. Thymbra includes two species of Satureja turning the latter genus polyphyletic. Thymus is revealed as paraphyletic with respect to Argantoniella and Saccocalyx in both and Origanum in the plastid dataset only. In the third lineage, the Clinopodium-group, branching pattern is highly incongruent among datasets and possibly influenced by recent and ancient hybridization, chloroplast capture and incomplete lineage sorting. However, identical terminal groups are inferred in both analyses. A Madagascan lineage of "Micromeria", sister to the recently described South African Killickia, is suggested to represent a new genus. The Himalayan Clinopodium nepalense group and the tropical African C. abyssinicum alliance are monophyletic but indicated in different positions. Both groups appear in the ITS phylogeny in a clade with Cyclotrichium and Mentha, relationships not suggested previously. The enigmatic Micromeria cymuligera is close to Mentha and possibly is a representative of this genus. Species of Acinos, now regarded as part of Clinopodium, are mixed up with species of Ziziphora, questioning either the inclusion of Acinos in Clinopodium or generic distinctness of Ziziphora. All data sets suggest a monophyly of the New World taxa and argue for long distance dispersal from the Old World, rather than a vicariance explanation. Bystropogon marks the split up between the two lineages. Inclusion of 22 genera intermixed with Clinopodium spp. in the New World clade provides evidence that the current circumscription of the genus is highly unnatural. Low sequence divergence resulting in low phylogenetic resolution especially at the base of the clade indicate a rapid radiation accompanied by considerable ecological diversification and speciation.},

abstract = {The volatile oil compositions of Thymus pannonicus All. from nineteen different localities of Hungary were analyzed by GC/MS. The essential oil content of the Hungarian thyme samples varied between very low (0.14 mL/100 g DW) and fairly high (1.9 mL/100 g DW) values. Significant essential oil polymorphism was found: altogether twelve chemovarieties may have been determined, representing a way of adaptation to different habitat conditions. The main volatile compound of chemotype 1 was thymol (24.6-67.5\%), while in the case of chemotype 2, thymol (36.5-63.7\%) and p-cymene (11.5-27.3\%) predominated. Thymol (28.4-63.7\%), p-cymene (11.5-31.8\%) and $\gamma$-terpinene (9.7-20.9\%) were identified as the chief monoterpenes of chemotype 3, while chemotype 4 contained thymol (36.5\%), p-cymene (27.3\%) and neral (11.2\%). Chemotype 5 accumulated thymol (38.5\%), p-cymene (20.6\%), $\gamma$-terpinene (12.0\%) and $\beta$-bisabolene (10.3\%) as its main volatiles. The oil of chemotype 6 can be characterized by thymol (41.9\%), p-cymene (20.2\%), isoborneol (10.3\%) and \~{a}-terpinene (9.9\%), while that of chemotype 7 consisted of thymol (27.7\%), linalyl acetate (18.8\%), $\gamma$-terpinene (18.6\%) and $\alpha$-cubebene (13.9\%). In the oil of chemotype 8, p-cymene (45.0\%), geraniol (13.6\%) and linalyl acetate (9.9\%) were found in higher percentages, while chemotype 9 mainly produced linalyl acetate (36.2\%) and geranyl acetate (20.2\%). Chemotype 10 accumulated germacrene-D (43.4) and $\beta$-caryophyllene (15.0\%), while the oil of chemotype 11 contained caryophyllene oxide (45.2\%), $\alpha$-cubebene (15.7\%) and linalool (13.8\%) in high proportions. Germacrene-D (29.7\%), $\beta$-caryophyllene (22.0\%) and farnesol (10.4\%) were identified as main essential oil compounds of chemotype 12. The last nine chemotypes were new for the literature, while the first seven contained thymol as their chief compound. The role of certain sesquiterpenes was found to be considerable.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thymus argaeus Boiss. \& Bal. (Lamiaceae), an endemic plant species of Turkey known as wild thyme, is traditionally used as a spice and a wild tea in the Inner Anatolia region of Turkey. In this study the composition of the essential oil and the antimicrobial and antioxidant effects of the methanolic extract and essential oil of T. argaeus were determined.RESULTS: The main components of the essential oil were linalool (499 g kg-1), [alpha]-terpineol (150 g kg-1), linalyl acetate (97 g kg-1) and thymol (94 g kg-1). The total phenolic, flavanol and flavonol contents of the extract were 83.31 ± 0.59 mg gallic acid equivalent g-1, 6.26 ± 0.00 mg catechin equivalent g-1 and 28.81 ± 0.21 mg rutin equivalent g-1 respectively. The antioxidant activities of the extract and essential oil determined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging method were 830.18 ± 0.42 and 20.47 ± 2.3 mg g-1 respectively. The antimicrobial activities of the extract and essential oil against 13 bacteria and two yeasts were studied by the agar diffusion method. The micro-organisms most sensitive to the essential oil were Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the micro-organism most sensitive to the extract was P. aeruginosa.CONCLUSION: Only the extract of T. argaeus could be used as a natural antioxidant, while both the extract and the essential oil could be useful as natural antimicrobial agents in food preservation.

abstract = {Thyme is a broncholytic und secretomotoric agent. Thus, our aim was to investigate the influence of a thyme extract on beta(2)-receptors in competition binding experiments and relaxation experiments on rat uteri and trachea. Furthermore, the influence of the extract on respiratory clearance was of interest. Binding experiments were performed using purified rat lung membranes with the beta(2)-receptor ligand [I-125]-Cyp \{[I-125]-(+/-)-lodocyanopindolol\}. The transport of the fluorescence dye rhodamin 123 concerning ciliary action in the tracheal area of a mouse was investigated using a microdialysis technique. The thyme extract reduces only slightly [I-125]-CYP binding and amplifies the displacement of [I-125]-CYP by propranolol (non-specific P-receptor antagonist): the displacement curve in the concentration range representing beta(2)-receptors (nM) is shifted to the left. Thyme extract had relaxing effects on organs possessing beta(2)-receptors (uterus and trachea). The propranolol-induced antagonism to isoprenaline is reverted concentration-dependently by the extract. A duplication of the rate of ciliary clearance by the extract was ob-served. In conclusion: 1) There is evidence for an influence of a thyme extract on beta(2)-receptors by both binding studies and biological effects: As can be derived from the shift of the propranotol displacement curve (nM), ingredients of the thyme extract slightly interact with beta(2)-receptors in rat lung tissue. This effect is indirect since no full range competition curve was reached. 2) An at least indirect interaction with beta(2)-receptors in rat uteri and trachea is revealed by a decreased antagonism of propranolol on the relaxing effect of isoprenaline by the plant extract. 3) An additional mechanism is presumed because at high extract concentrations isoprenaline-induced relaxation is complete, whereas the displacement of propranolol at beta(2)-receptors is only weak. 4) Thyme extract has an indirect (modulatory) effect on the beta(2)-receptor system. 5) Mucociliary clearance is improved in vivo. Its mechanism has still to be elucidated.},

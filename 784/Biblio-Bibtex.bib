	abstract = {Rad51, a conserved eukaryotic protein, mediates the homologous-recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks that occur during both mitosis and meiosis. During prophase I of meiosis, homologous recombination enhances the linkage between homologous chromosomes to increase the accuracy of segregation at anaphase I. In polyploidy situtations, however, difficulties with homologous chromosome segregation often disrupt meiosis. Yet, triploid individuals of the planarian Dugesia ryukyuensis are able to produce functional gametes through a specialized form of meiosis. To shed light on the molecular mechanisms that promote successful meiosis in triploid D. ryukyuensis, we investigated rad51 gene function. We isolated three genes of the Rad51 family, the Rad51 homolog Dr-rad51 and the Rad51 paralogs Dr-rad51B and Dr-rad51C. Dr-rad51 was expressed in germ-line and presumably in somatic stem cells, but was not necessary for the regeneration of somatic tissue. RNA-interference (RNAi) depletion of Dr-rad51 during sexualization did not affect chromosome behavior in zygotene oocytes, but did result in the loss of chiasmata at the diplotene stage. Thus, homologous recombination does not appear to be necessary for synapsis, but is needed for crossover and proper segregation in D. ryukyuensis.},

	pages = {e297},
	abstract = {Non-indigenous terrestrial flatworms (Platyhelminthes) have been recorded in thirteen European countries. They include Bipalium kewense and Dolichoplana striata that are largely restricted to hothouses and may be regarded as non-invasive species. In addition there are species from the southern hemisphere such as the invasive New Zealand flatworm Arthurdendyus triangulatus in the United Kingdom, Eire and the Faroe Islands, the Australian flatworm Australoplana sanguinea alba in Eire and the United Kingdom, and the Australian Blue Garden flatworm Caenoplana coerulea in France, Menorca and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has some twelve or more non-indigenous species most of which are Australian and New Zealand species. These species may move to an invasive stage when optimum environmental and other conditions occur, and the flatworms then have the potential to cause economic or environmental harm. In this paper, we report the identification (from morphology and molecular analysis of COI sequences) of non-indigenous terrestrial flatworms found in a hothouse in Caen (France) as the New Guinea flatworm Platydemus manokwari de Beauchamp, 1963 (Platyhelminthes, Continenticola, Geoplanidae, Rhynchodeminae). Platydemus manokwari is among the {\textquotedblleft}100 World{\textquoteright}s Worst Invader Alien Species{\textquotedblright}. Lists of World geographic records, prey in the field and prey in laboratories of P. manokwari are provided. This species is considered a threat to native snails wherever it is introduced. The recent discovery of P. manokwari in France represents a significant extension of distribution of this Invasive Alien Species from the Indo-Pacific region to Europe. If it escaped the hothouse, the flatworm might survive winters and become established in temperate countries. The existence of this species in France requires an early warning of this incursion to State and European Union authorities, followed by the eradication of the flatworm in its locality, tightening of internal quarantine measures to prevent further spread of the flatworm to and from this site, identifying if possible the likely primary source of the flatworm, and tracing other possible incursions that may have resulted from accidental dispersal of plants and soil from the site.},

	abstract = {In this study we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of eastern Mediterranean freshwater planarians of the genus Dugesia, estimated divergence times for the various clades, and correlated their phylogeographic patterns with geological and paleoclimatic events, in order to discover which evolutionary processes have shaped the present-day distribution of these animals. Specimens were collected from freshwater courses and lakes in continental and insular Greece. Genetic divergences and phylogenetic relationships were inferred by using the mitochondrial gene subunit I of cytochrome oxidase (COI) and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS-1) from 74 newly collected individuals from Greece. Divergence time estimates were obtained under a Bayesian framework, using the COI sequences. Two alternative geological dates for the isolation of Crete from the mainland were tested as calibration points. A clear phylogeographic pattern was present for Dugesia lineages in the Eastern Mediterranean. Morphological data, combined with information on genetic divergences, revealed that eight out of the nine known species were represented in the samples, while additional new, and still undescribed species were detected. Divergence time analyses suggested that Dugesia species became isolated in Crete after the first geological isolation of the island, and that their present distribution in the Eastern Mediterranean has been shaped mainly by vicariant events but also by dispersal. During the Messinian salinity crisis these freshwater planarians apparently were not able to cross the sea barrier between Crete and the mainland, while they probably did disperse between islands in the Aegean Sea. Their dependence on freshwater to survive suggests the presence of contiguous freshwater bodies in those regions. Our results also suggest a major extinction of freshwater planarians on the Peloponnese at the end of the Pliocene, while about 2 Mya ago, when the current Mediterranean climate was established, these Peloponnese populations probably began to disperse again. At the end of the Pliocene or during the Pleistocene, mainland populations of Dugesia colonized the western coast, including the Ionian Islands, which were then part of the continent.},

The morphological information obtained for the specimens was used in a traditional way by comparing the organismal traits of the various populations and candidate species with those of known species, as documented in the taxonomic literature and as revealed by examination of histological sections of museum specimens. In the molecular species delimitation the General Mixed Yule-Coalescent method (GMYC) was used. Results of this study (1) supported the presence of 13 Dugesia species in the Hellenic area (including D. sicula Lepori, 1948, a pan-Mediterranean species), (2) culminated in the description of four new Dugesia species, (3) suggested the presence of two Confirmed Candidate Species, (4) pointed to 12 GMYC-delimited units in Greece and two in Slovakia as Unconfirmed Candidate Species and (5) revealed the presence of an entirely new genus, represented by two newly described species and a third Unconfirmed Candidate Species. Our results revealed a high diversity of dugesiid species in this relatively small region. It is concluded that the morphological features used by taxonomists in comparative studies of dugesiid flatworms generally result in reliable identifications and delineations of species taxa, except in the case of cryptic species.},

In the peripheral portion of the ovary, the oogonia are recognized as undifferentiated germ cells, which are morphologically similar to neoblasts that have a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio. Oocyte maturation is characterized by a marked growth of the cytoplasm because of the accumulation of cytoplasmic organelles and inclusions. The Golgi complexes begin to increase within the ooplasm and produce vesicles with an electron-dense content that fuse to produce larger spherical globules with homogeneous and electron-dense material. In the mature oocyte, the spherical globules migrate toward the cortical ooplasm, forming a continuous monolayer. We confirm that these spherical globules, which represent cortical granules rather than eggshell globules, vary in size up to 2 μm and their electron-dense content shows concentric thin bands. After leaving the ovary through the oviduct, the mature and fertilized oocytes reach the female atrium where they are packaged with thousands of vitelline cells in the cocoon shell. Based on our ultrastructural analysis, we demonstrate that the wall of the cocoon shell is composed of two layers, each of which has a different origin. The shell granules extruded from the vitelline cells are involved in the secretion of the inner layer of the cocoon shell, whereas the outer layer of the cocoon shell is synthesized by the epithelial cells in the genital atrium.},

	journal = {BMC Evolutionary Biology},
	volume = {13},
	year = {2013},
	chapter = {268},
	abstract = {Background

Dugesia sicula is the only species of its genus not presenting an endemic or restricted distribution within the Mediterranean area. It mostly comprises fissiparous populations (asexual reproduction by body division and regeneration), most likely sexually sterile, and characterized by an extremely low genetic diversity interpreted as the consequence of a recent anthropic expansion. However, its fissiparous reproduction can result in an apparent lack of diversity within the species, since genetic variation within individuals can be as large as between them because most individuals within a population are clones. We have estimated haplotype and nucleotide diversity of cytochrome oxidase I within and among individuals along the species distribution of a broad sample of D. sicula, including asexual and the two only sexual populations known today; and predicted its potential distribution based on climatic variables. Our aim was to determine the centre of colonisation origin, whether the populations are recent, and whether the species is expanding.

Results

The species presents 3 most frequent haplotypes, differing in a maximum of 11 base pairs. As expected from their fissiparous mode of reproduction, in half of all the analysed localities many individuals have multiple heteroplasmic haplotypes. The distribution of haplotypes is not geographically structured; however, the distribution of haplotypes and heteroplasmic populations shows higher diversity in the central Mediterranean region. The potential distribution predicted by climatic variables based modelling shows a preference for coastal areas and fits well with the observed data.

Conclusions

The distribution and frequency of the most frequent haplotypes and the presence of heteroplasmic individuals allow us to gain an understanding of the recent history of the species, together with previous knowledge on its phylogenetic relationships and age: The species most probably originated in Africa and dispersed through the central Mediterranean. After one or multiple populations became triploid and fissiparous, the species colonized the Mediterranean basin, likely both by its own means and helped by human activities. Its present distribution practically fulfils its potential distribution as modelled with climatic variables. Its prevalence in coastal regions with higher water temperatures predicts a likely future expansion to northern and more interior areas following the increase in temperatures due to climate change. },

	abstract = {Species capable of regenerating lost body parts occur throughout the animal kingdom, yet close relatives are often regeneration incompetent. Why in the face of {\textquoteleft}survival of the fittest{\textquoteright} some animals regenerate but others do not remains a fascinating question. Planarian flatworms are well known and studied for their ability to regenerate from minute tissue pieces, yet species with limited regeneration abilities have been described even amongst planarians4. Here we report the characterization of the regeneration defect in the planarian Dendrocoelum lacteum and its successful rescue. Tissue fragments cut from the posterior half of the body of this species are unable to regenerate a head and ultimately die5. We find that this defect originates during the early stages of head specification, which require inhibition of canonical Wnt signalling in other planarian species. Notably, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of Dlac-β-catenin-1, the Wnt signal transducer, restored the regeneration of fully functional heads on tail pieces, rescuing D. lacteum{\textquoteright}s regeneration defect. Our results demonstrate the utility of comparative studies towards the reactivation of regenerative abilities in regeneration-deficient animals. Furthermore, the availability of D. lacteum as a regeneration-impaired planarian model species provides a first step towards elucidating the evolutionary mechanisms that ultimately determine why some animals regenerate and others do not.},

The genome of D. japonica contained 36 genes including 12 of the 13 protein-coding genes characteristic of metazoan mitochondrial genomes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes. The genome of D. ryukyuensis contained 33 genes, including 12 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and 19 transfer RNA genes. The gene order of the mitochondrial genome from the Dugesia species showed no clear homology with either the Neodermata or other free-living Rhabditophora. This indicates that the platyhelminths exhibit great variability in mitochondrial gene order. This is the first complete sequence analysis of the mitochondrial genome of a free-living member of Rhabditophora, which will facilitate further studies on the population genetics and genomic evolution of the Platyhelminthes.},

However, no studies investigating implications of organic pollutants on this food web subsystem currently exist. Hence, the present study assessed short-term implications of pesticides with different modes of action, namely, the triazole fungicide tebuconazole and the pyrethroid insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin, during a 72 h trial. The experiments for tebuconazole showed a statistically significant decrease in predatory success of D. lacteum. Lambda-cyhalothrin, in contrast, increased predation success by 40\%, which is, however, not statistically significant. Both the decrease and the increase in predation seemed to be primarily driven by an altered activity of the prey A. aquaticus. This may be hypothesized because any shift in the prey{\textquoteright}s activity influenced its probability to stick to mucus, a viscous substance released by D. lacteum, or to encounter the predator directly.},

	abstract = {Background

Planarians are considered to be among the extant animals close to one of the earliest groups of organisms that acquired a central nervous system (CNS) during evolution. Planarians have a bilobed brain with nine lateral branches from which a variety of external signals are projected into different portions of the main lobes. Various interneurons process different signals to regulate behavior and learning/memory. Furthermore, planarians have robust regenerative ability and are attracting attention as a new model organism for the study of regeneration. Here we conducted large-scale EST analysis of the head region of the planarian Dugesia japonica to construct a database of the head-region transcriptome, and then performed comparative analyses among related species.

Results

A total of 54,752 high-quality EST reads were obtained from a head library of the planarian Dugesia japonica, and 13,167 unigene sequences were produced by de novo assembly. A new method devised here revealed that proteins related to metabolism and defense mechanisms have high flexibility of amino-acid substitutions within the planarian family. Eight-two CNS-development genes were found in the planarian (cf. C. elegans 3; chicken 129). Comparative analysis revealed that 91\% of the planarian CNS-development genes could be mapped onto the schistosome genome, but one-third of these shared genes were not expressed in the schistosome.

Conclusions

We constructed a database that is a useful resource for comparative planarian transcriptome studies. Analysis comparing homologous genes between two planarian species showed that the potential of genes is important for accumulation of amino-acid substitutions. The presence of many CNS-development genes in our database supports the notion that the planarian has a fundamental brain with regard to evolution and development at not only the morphological/functional, but also the genomic, level. In addition, our results indicate that the planarian CNS-development genes already existed before the divergence of planarians and schistosomes from their common ancestor.

	abstract = {There are several records of the carnivorous behaviour of land flatworms, considered to be top-predators in their micro-habitats, by preying upon various species of invertebrates. However, there is little knowledge of predators on land-flatworms. The possible impact of invasive land flatworms on prey populations has caused widespread concern, when considering their predatory behaviour, combined with recent human influence on the distribution of certain species. This work is the first record of predation on land flatworms by a carnivorous snail. Various-sized land flatworms of 10 native species of the subfamily Geoplaninae, as well as the exotic species Bipalium kewense (subfamily Bipaliinae), were offered to Rectartemon depressus (Gastropoda, Streptaxidae), which accepted all. The predator also fed on the snail Bradybaena similaris. The snails were maintained in laboratory for an average period of 12?months based on a mixed diet of flatworms and B. similaris, suggesting that the snail is a polyphagous predator. Because certain land-flatworm species have been described as invasive species which may have a potential impact on prey populations in native and man-made ecosystems, it is proposed that carnivorous snails of other native species, as potential predators of flatworms, should be tested for possible use in biological control programmes of these invasive planarians.},

	abstract = {Within the free-living platyhelminths, the triclads, or planarians, are the best-known group, largely as a result of long-standing and intensive research on regeneration, pattern formation and Hox gene expression. However, the group{\textquoteright}s evolutionary history has been long debated, with controversies ranging from their phyletic structure and position within the Metazoa to the relationships among species within the Tricladida. Over the the last decade, with the advent of molecular phylogenies, some of these issues have begun to be resolved. Here, we present an up-to-date summary of the main phylogenetic changes and novelties with some comments on their evolutionary implications. The phylum has been split into two groups, and the position of the main group (the Rhabdithophora and the Catenulida), close to the Annelida and the Mollusca within the Lophotrochozoa, is now clear. Their internal relationships, although not totally resolved, have been clarified. Tricladida systematics has also experienced a revolution since the implementation of molecular data. The terrestrial planarians have been demonstrated to have emerged from one of the freshwater families, giving a different view of their evolution and greatly altering their classification. The use of molecular data is also facilitating the identification of Tricladida species by DNA barcoding, allowing better knowledge of their distribution and genetic diversity. Finally, molecular phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses, taking advantage of recent data, are beginning to give a clear picture of the recent history of the Dugesia and Schmidtea species in the Mediterranean. },

Planarians are flatworms and regenerate from tiny body fragments, a process requiring a population of proliferating cells (neoblasts). Whether regeneration is accomplished by pluripotent cells or by the collective activity of multiple lineage-restricted cell types is unknown. We used ionizing radiation and single-cell transplantation to identify neoblasts that can form large descendant-cell colonies in vivo. These clonogenic neoblasts (cNeoblasts) produce cells that differentiate into neuronal, intestinal, and other known postmitotic cell types and are distributed throughout the body. Single transplanted cNeoblasts restored regeneration in lethally irradiated hosts. We conclude that broadly distributed, adult pluripotent stem cells underlie the remarkable regenerative abilities of planarians.},

Intact egg clutches encompassing eight snail species x three developmental stages were offered to Dugesia (= Schmidtea) polychroa (Paludicola: Dugesiidae) individuals (body length = 6-12 mm) in one-on-one, no-choice 24-h feeding trials to gain a first insight on snail egg palatability to dugesiid planarias. Predatory losses were quantified as differences in planaria-present trials vs. parallel planaria-absent controls. D. polychroa predation on snail eggs was generally low. Eggs in monolayered, flat clutches of bithyniids (Bithynia leachii) and planorbids (Planorbis planorbis, Helisoma trivolvis, and Planorbarius corneus) were more susceptible to planarian predation than multilayered eggs in sausage-shaped clutches of physids (Physa acuta) and lymnaeids (Lymnaea stagnalis, Radix auricularia, and Stagnicola fuscus). Planarian predation also was higher on smaller eggs, and was not related to planarian body size. Vulnerability was also markedly species-specific, with appreciable losses recorded only for pre-hatching eggs of P. planorbis and, to a lesser extent, H. trivolvis. The results suggest that, with the possible exception for the soft-clutch, small eggs of P. planorbis, predation by D. polychroa on eggs does not impact gastropod recruitment appreciably.},

	abstract = {Many species of land flatworms have been described based on specimens, or even on a single specimen, from a sole locality. Thus, populational or individual variations are poorly known. The external morphology of Geoplana multicolor Graff, 1899 was first described based on a single specimen from the vicinities of the city of S{\~a}o Paulo, South Brazil. Marcus (1951) analysed specimens from S{\~a}o Paulo with a similar external aspect and considered them as conspecific with G. multicolor, describing their internal anatomy. In the present work, we amplify the known distribution of the species, by registering its occurrence in four localities of southern Brazil (state of Rio Grande do Sul), and comparatively analyse this relatively ample material, which includes different developmental phases. The description of histological aspects, especially those regarding musculature and secretory cells of the copulatory organs, has been enhanced and amplified after the present analysis. Thus, the description of G. multicolor is here complemented, with an improvement on the interpretation of important taxonomical characters. In addition, the paper reports, for the first time, the occurrence of an ejaculate attached to the atrial wall of a species of Geoplaninae which presents a penis papilla, and briefly discusses its significance.},

Paleoclimatic models have predicted two large stability regions in its northern and central parts, whereas southern regions might have suffered strong instability during Pleistocene glaciations. Molecular phylogeographic and endemism studies show, nevertheless, contradictory results: although some results validate these predictions, other data suggest that paleoclimatic models fail to predict stable rainforest areas in the south. Most studies, however, have surveyed species with relatively high dispersal rates whereas taxa with lower dispersion capabilities should be better predictors of habitat stability. Here, we have used two land planarian species as model organisms to analyse the patterns and levels of nucleotide diversity on a locality within the Southern Atlantic Forest. We find that both species harbour high levels of genetic variability without exhibiting the molecular footprint of recent colonization or population expansions, suggesting a long-term stability scenario. The results reflect, therefore, that paleoclimatic models may fail to detect refugia in the Southern Atlantic Forest, and that model organisms with low dispersal capability can improve the resolution of these models.},

	journal = {BMC Developmental Biology},
	volume = {11},
	year = {2011},
	pages = {69},
	abstract = {Background

The freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea exhibits two distinct reproductive modes. Individuals of the sexual strain are cross-fertilizing hermaphrodites with reproductive organs that develop post-embryonically. By contrast, individuals of the asexual strain reproduce exclusively by transverse fission and fail to develop reproductive organs. These different reproductive strains are associated with distinct karyotypes, making S. mediterranea a useful model for studying germline development and sexual differentiation.

Results

To identify genes expressed differentially between these strains, we performed microarray analyses and identified >800 genes that were upregulated in the sexual planarian. From these, we characterized 24 genes by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), revealing their expression in male germ cells or accessory reproductive organs. To identify additional markers of the planarian reproductive system, we also used immuno- and fluorescent lectin staining, identifying several antibodies and lectins that labeled structures associated with reproductive organs.

Conclusions

Collectively, these cell-type specific markers will enable future efforts to characterize genes that are important for reproductive development in the planarian.

	journal = {Frontiers in Zoology},
	volume = {8},
	year = {2011},
	pages = {23},
	abstract = {Background

The mechanisms underlying the switching from an asexual to a sexual mode of reproduction, and vice versa, remain unknown in metazoans. In planarians, asexual worms acquire cryptic sexuality when fed with sexual worms, indicating that sexual worms contain a sex-inducing substance. Although such a chemical compound will provide clues about the mechanisms underlying the switching, information on the sex-inducing substance is poor. In order to identify this substance, we have established an assay system for sexual induction in asexual worms of Dugesia ryukyuensis by feeding them with sexual worms. Here, we carried out an isolation study on the sex-inducing substance using this assay system.

Results

After centrifugation of sexual worms homogenised in saline solution, we found that not only did the precipitate have a sex-inducing effect on the asexual worms, which has been shown previously, but the cytosolic fraction did as well. We confirmed that the sex-inducing activity in the cytosolic fraction was recovered in a hydrophilic fraction separated on an octadecylsilane (ODS) column. We showed that the sex-inducing substance in the hydrophilic fraction is papain-resistant and a putative low-molecular-weight compound of less than 500. We also suggest the presence of an enhancer of sexual induction with a molecular weight (MW) of more than 5 K in the hydrophilic fraction.

Conclusion

Our experiments showed the existence of a sex-inducing substance and an enhancer of sex-induction in a hydrophilic fraction, and a putative hydrophobic sex-inducing substance in the precipitate. Sexual induction in the asexual worms might be triggered by additive or synergistic effects of these chemical compounds.

	abstract = {The flatworm Platydemus manokwari (Tricladida: Rhynchodemidae) preys on various species of land snail, and its introduction to areas outside of its native range is thought to have caused the extinction of native land snails on several Pacific islands. Platydemus manokwari occurs in areas where land snails have been absent since its invasion, suggesting that the flatworm can prey on animals other than land snails. To identify the alternative prey and prey preferences of P. manokwari, I examined the feeding ecology of P. manokwari under field and laboratory conditions. Individuals were observed attacking live earthworms in a forest where land snails are already extinct, on Chichijima, Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, Japan. I also observed them attacking earthworms and a species of isopod and land snail in the lab. To prey on the worm, similar to other earthworm-eating flatworms, P. manokwari wrapped itself around the prey and fed on it by inserting its pharynx into the earthworm{\textquoteright}s body. Large earthworms were able to escape P. manokwari attacks by autotomy, but the autotomized body parts were eaten. Several P. manokwari individuals together attacked earthworms that were larger than themselves. The laboratory experiments showed that such gregarious attacks increased predation success on both large earthworms and land snails. The flatworms also attacked the isopods, although the predation rate was low. These results demonstrate that P. manokwari is a polyphagous predator of slowmoving soil invertebrates (land snails, slugs, earthworms, and isopods) and that invasion by P. manokwari may directly and indirectly impact native soil fauna.},

The community composition of land flatworms of areas of Deciduous Forest, which occupies a quarter of the vegetal cover of the state, is poorly known. The present study inventoried land planarians of the largest remnant of this type of forest in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, the Turvo State Park (SP-Turvo) and compared their communities with those of other localities of the state with inventories of land flatworms. We inventoried 26 species, two of them belonging to the subfamilies Rhynchodeminae and Bipaliinae, and 24 to the subfamily Geoplaninae. Besides the genera Rhynchodemus Leidy 1851 and Bipalium Stimpson, 1857, the following Geoplaninae genera were recorded: Geoplana Stimpson 1857, Choeradoplana Graff 1896, Pasipha Ogren \& Kawakatsu 1990 and Notogynaphallia Ogren \& Kawakatsu 1990, as well as the collective group Pseudogeoplana Ogren \& Kawakatsu, 1990. The highest species richness was registered for the genus Geoplana (10), followed by the genus Pasipha (4). Geoplana rubidolineata Baptista \& Leal-Zanchet, 2005 was previously only known from its type-locality, located in the northeast of the state. Bipaliumke wense Moseley, 1878 which shows a cosmopolitan distribution was observed in a man-disturbed area, not being registered in forest areas. We employed an NMDS ordination to compare land planarian communities of the Turvo State Park to those of other types of forest of the state. The analysis indicated that land planarian communities of the Turvo State Park and those of other areas with Deciduous, Semideciduous and Dense Ombrophilous Forests differ from those of Mixed Ombrophilous Forests of the region. The high observed species richness in the Turvo State Park reinforces its important contribution for the conservation of the regional diversity.},

Herein, we investigated spatial patterns of land flatworm communities in the three main existent vegetation types of the most significant remnant of the subtropical deciduous forest in south Brazil. The main questions were: (1) How species-rich is the study area? (2) How are community-structure attributes allocated in areas with distinct floristic composition? (3) What are the effects of soil humidity and soil organic matter content on flatworm abundance? (4) Are there seasonal differences regarding species richness? (5) Are the communities in the three types of vegetation distinct? Twenty-two flatworm species, distributed in five genera and two subfamilies, were recorded. Results indicated that: (1) species richness, evenness, abundance, and dominance in the three vegetation types are not significantly different; (2) diversity indices were higher for areas with caducifolious forest than for areas with jaboticaba trees with marginally significant differences; (3) flatworm abundance is negatively related to soil organic matter; (4) there are no significant differences in flatworm species richness throughout the year; and (5) flatworm communities in the three types of vegetation are not distinct. Soil organic matter content was abundant at sites with distinct vegetation types, thereby negatively affecting flatworm abundance. The original vegetation of the study area has been well-preserved, which may be an explanation for the absence of a clear separation of the flatworm communities of the three main types of vegetation in the study area.},

A plastic treatment plate with the mucus trail of a single species and a control plate without the trail were placed side by side at the exit of cages housing P. manokwari . All trials were then videotaped overnight. The flatworms moved along plates with mucus trails, but did not respond to plates without trails, blank control (distilled water), or with conspecific flatworm trails. When presented at the midpoint of a snail mucus trail, the flatworms followed the trail in a random direction. The flatworms showed a preference when choosing between two plates, each with a mucus trail of different land snail species.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Freshwater planarians are an attractive model for regeneration and stem cell research and have become a promising tool in the field of regenerative medicine. With the availability of a sequenced planarian genome, the recent application of modern genetic and high-throughput tools has resulted in revitalized interest in these animals, long known for their amazing regenerative capabilities, which enable them to regrow even a new head after decapitation. However, a detailed description of the planarian transcriptome is essential for future investigation into regenerative processes using planarians as a model system.RESULTS:In order to complement and improve existing gene annotations, we used a 454 pyrosequencing approach to analyze the transcriptome of the planarian species Schmidtea mediterranea Altogether, 598,435 454-sequencing reads, with an average length of 327 bp, were assembled together with the ~10,000 sequences of the S. mediterranea UniGene set using different similarity cutoffs. The assembly was then mapped onto the current genome data. Remarkably, our Smed454 dataset contains more than 3 million novel transcribed nucleotides sequenced for the first time. A descriptive analysis of planarian splice sites was conducted on those Smed454 contigs that mapped univocally to the current genome assembly. Sequence analysis allowed us to identify genes encoding putative proteins with defined structural properties, such as transmembrane domains. Moreover, we annotated the Smed454 dataset using Gene Ontology, and identified putative homologues of several gene families that may play a key role during regeneration, such as neurotransmitter and hormone receptors, homeobox-containing genes, and genes related to eye function.CONCLUSIONS:We report the first planarian transcript dataset, Smed454, as an open resource tool that can be accessed via a web interface. Smed454 contains significant novel sequence information about most expressed genes of S. mediterranea. Analysis of the annotated data promises to contribute to identification of gene families poorly characterized at a functional level. The Smed454 transcriptome data will assist in the molecular characterization of S. mediterranea as a model organism, which will be useful to a broad scientific community.},

	abstract = {Araucaria forests are among the most threatened biomes of one of the world{\textquoteright}s 25 biodiversity hotspots, the south Brazilian Atlantic Rain Forest. This study was focused on flatworm community structure in three protected areas located on the eastern border of the Araucaria Plateau in south Brazil. We addressed three main questions: (1) How species-rich are Araucaria forests? (2) Are there any differences in the community structure within the three areas? (3) What is the distribution pattern of land flatworms in this type of forest? A total of 51 flatworm species in ten genera and two subfamilies were found. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis showed that the assemblage structure differed within the three areas. The abundance and richness varied in time, being affected by an interaction between season and areas. Araucaria forests on the eastern border of the Araucaria Plateau should be considered a hotspot of land planarian diversity, harboring an estimated 64 species. The high combined species richness in the protected areas studied emphasizes the importance of their preservation. Notwithstanding their close proximity, they are not redundant in maintaining regional biodiversity.},

This TEM-study shows that early spermatids joined by cytophores have rounded nuclei. During spermiogenesis, a row of microtubules appears in the differentiation zone beneath the plasma membrane and close to the intercentriolar body, which consists of several dense bands connected by filaments. Two free flagella (9+1 configuration) grow outside the spermatid. An apical layer of dense nucleoplasm develops and the flagellum appear, facing in opposite directions before rotating to lie parallel to each other after the intercentriolar body splits into two halves. Mitochondria are closely packed around the spermatocyte nucleus before fusing during spermiogenesis, to form a long mitochondrion, which lies parallel to the elongated nucleus along the ripe spermatozoon. The latter is thread-shaped and consists of two regions: the proximal process and a distal part. The former contains the nucleus and a part of the mitochondrion. The latter contains the rest of the mitochondrion and a tapering tail of the nucleus. Separation between these two regions is marked externally by the insertion zone of the two free flagella. The flagella extend posteriorly along the distal part of the spermatozoon. The spermatozoon nucleus consists of a lucent and a dense component coiled in a screw-like pattern around each other. The single row of peripheral microtubules consists of a maximum 40 microtubules in the middle part with an internal layer of three supplementary microtubules.},

	abstract = {The female gonad of the land planarians Microplana scharffi and Microplana terrestris consists of two small germaria located ventrally in the anterior third of the body and of two ventro-lateral rows of oblong vitelline follicles distributed between the intestinal pouches. Both these structures are enveloped by a tunica composed of an outer extracellular lamina and an inner sheath of accessory cells. Oocyte maturation is characterized by the appearance of chromatoid bodies and the development of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complexes. These organelles appear to be correlated with the production of egg granules with a fenestrated/granular content of medium electron density, about 4{\textendash}5 μm in diameter, which remain dispersed in the ooplasm of mature oocytes. On the basis of cytochemical tests showing their glycoprotein composition, and their localization in mature oocytes, these egg granules have been interpreted as yolk. In the vitelline follicles, vitellocytes show the typical features of secretory cells with well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complexes involved in the production of eggshell globules and yolk. The eggshell globules, which appear to arise from repeated coalescences of two types of Golgi-derived vesicles, contain polyphenols and, when completely mature, they measure about 1{\textendash}1,2 μm in diameter and show a meandering/concentric content pattern as is typical of the situation observed in most Proseriata and Tricladida. Mature vitellocytes also contain a large amount of glycogen and lipids as further reserve material. On the basis of the ultrastructural features of the female gonad and in relation to the current literature the two species of rhynchodemids investigated appear to be closely related to the freshwater planarians belonging to the family Dugesiidae.},

	abstract = {Planarians of the genus Dugesia have a worldwide distribution with high species diversity in the Mediterranean area. In this area, populations with a triploid karyotype that reproduce by fissiparity are exceptionally frequent, outnumbering the sexual populations. This situation poses interesting questions, such as the age of these asexual lineages, whether they all belong to the same species or whether the triploidization event is recurrent, and what factors (climatic, geographical, historical...) explain the prevalence of these asexual forms. However, asexual populations cannot be assigned to a species due to the lack of copulatory apparatus - the main structure used in species identification. In this study, we have developed a DNA barcoding method, based on COI and ITS-1 sequences, which allows the assignment of the fissiparous forms to sexual species. At the same time, phylogenetic analysis from species of the western Mediterranean have unveiled the presence of species with highly differentiated populations alongside species with a wide distribution and almost no genetic variation. The roles of habitat instability, dispersal capacity and human activities are briefly discussed.},

Although P. manokwari is known to attack land snails on the ground, whether P. manokwari attacks snails on trees remains unclear. To clarify the effect of P. manokwari on arboreal snails, we examined survival rates of land snails experimentally placed on tree trunks (0.5{\textendash}2.0 m above the ground) in a forest on Chichijima, Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The survival of snails experimentally placed on tree trunks with artificially created snail scent trails rapidly decreased for 7 days, and the mortality was caused by P. manokwari predation. However, snails placed on tree trunks without snail scent trails were not attacked by P. manokwari. Therefore, P. manokwari climbed tree trunks, likely tracking the snail scent. We found that over 40\% of the snails placed on tree trunks with snail scent trails were eaten by P. manokwari within 7 days. This experiment supports the hypothesis that P. manokwari predation is an important cause of the rapid decline or extinction of native arboreal snails on Pacific islands.},

	abstract = {Land flatworms are carnivorous, mainly predators. However, knowledge on their predatory behavior and prey preference is very scarce. This paucity of data is a limiting factor in the study of their biology and organismal ecology, resulting in a very difficult task to breed them in the laboratory for prolonged periods if prey preference and predation frequency are unknown. We investigated the predatory behavior of Notogynaphallia abundans (Graff, 1899), Geoplaninae, based on laboratory experiments. In order to determine its predatory choices, we offered mollusks, earthworms, arthropods, and other land flatworms. Only land isopods were accepted, with an average consumption of 3.4 individuals per week. Linear regression showed a positive relationship between the number of consumed isopods and the increase/decrease in body mass. Consumption resulting in an increase in body mass was ca. four isopods per week. Predatory behavior, with a mean time-span of 28 min 45 s {\textpm} 15 min 47 s, includes encounter and capture of prey, immobilization, handling and feeding. Variation in the duration of this activity in N. abundans is clearly due to variations in the time necessary for transferring the prey from either the anterior or posterior thirds of the body to the mouth, as well as for external digestion and ingestion. In order to capture very active and fast-moving animals such as land isopods, N. abundans employs various strategies, using either the anterior or the posterior body regions to press the prey against the ground or against its own body, thus allowing it to deal with various responses by the prey, and thereby maximizing predatory success. Similar to other flatworms, both physical holding and entrapment in a mucous secretion are of fundamental importance for prey-immobilization. The different strategies employed by land flatworms in their predatory behavior are discussed, and behavioral plasticity in the capture and immobilization of prey in different platyhelminth groups is emphasized.},

As the factors influencing flatworm predation pressure on land snails remain unclear, I examined the effects of seasonal variation in flatworm predation pressure on land snail survival in the wild on a subtropical island. I also examined the feeding activities of P. manokwari under laboratory conditions. Survival rates of land snails experimentally placed on the forest floor for 7 days ranged from 0\% to 100\% among seasons on the oceanic island Chichijima [Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands]. More than 90\% of snails were killed by P. manokwari within 7 days in the period from July to November, while less than 40\% of snails were killed in other months. Snail mortality rate (0{\textendash}100\%) attributable to P. manokwari was positively correlated with mean temperature (17.1{\textendash}27.3 {\textdegree}C) in the study area. Laboratory experiments showed that low temperature influenced snail survival and regulated feeding activity of P. manokwari. Laboratory experiments also suggested that high densities of P. manokwari may cause a rapid decline in snail survival. Therefore, ambient temperature and density of P. manokwari may regulate seasonal variations in predation pressure on land snails. Recent global warming may increase the probability of invasion and population establishment, and elevate the impacts of P. manokwari in temperate regions.},

Molecular analyses have demonstrated that the Paludicola are paraphyletic, the Terricola being the sister group of one of the three paludicolan families, the Dugesiidae. However, neither 18S rDNA nor COI based trees have been able to resolve the relationships among species of Terricola and Dugesiidae, particularly the monophyly of Terricola. Here, we present new molecular data including sequences of nuclear genes (18S rDNA, 28S rDNA) and a mitochondrial gene (COI) of a wider sample of dugesiid and terricolan species. The new sequences have been analyzed, together with those previously obtained, in independent and concatenated analyses using maximum likelihood and bayesian methods. The results show that, although some parts of the trees remain poorly resolved, they support a monophyletic origin for Terricola followed by a likely return of some species to freshwater habitats. Relationships within the monophyletic group of Dugesiidae are clearly resolved, and relationships among some terricolan subfamilies are also clearly established and point to the need for a thorough revision of Terricola taxonomy.},

We registered 20 species, two of them belonging to the family Rhynchodemidae (Rhynchodeminae), one to the genus Rhynchodemus Leidy, 1851 and the other to the genus Dolichoplana Moseley, 1877, and 18 to the family Geoplanidae (Geoplaninae). The latter are distributed in the genera Geoplana Stimpson, 1857, Notogynaphallia Ogren and Kawakatsu, 1990, and Pasipha Ogren and Kawakatsu, 1990, as well as in the collective group Pseudogeoplana Ogren and Kawakatsu, 1990. The genus Geoplana, with 7 species, showed the highest species richness. We observed 9 and 13 species, respectively, in the Campus of the UNISINOS and SP-Itapu{\~a}, with two species, Notogynaphallia abundans (Graff, 1899) and Geoplana gaucha Froehlich, 1959, common to both areas. The similarity between these two areas was low (0.1). The known distribution of Dolichoplana carvalhoi Correa, 1947, until now only known from its type-locality, the city of S{\~a}o Paulo, is thus amplified.},

	abstract = {Triploidy has generally been considered to be an evolutionary dead end due to problems of chromosomal pairing and segregation during meiosis. Thus, the formation of tetraploids and diploids from triploid types is a rare phenomenon. In the present study, we demonstrated that inbreeding of the triploid planarian Dugesia ryukyuensis resulted in both diploid and triploid offspring in nature. In the triploids of D. ryukyuensis , chiasmata between homologous chromosomes were observed in both female and male germ lines. This result suggests that both diploid and triploid offspring of this species are produced bisexually by zygotic fusion between sperm and eggs. Hence, this phenomenon may be a novel mechanism in planarian for escaping the triploid state.},

	abstract = {The planarian Dugesia ryukyuensis reproduces both asexually and sexually, and can switch from one mode of reproduction to the other. We recently developed a method for experimentally switching reproduction of the planarian from the asexual to the sexual mode. We constructed a cDNA library from sexualized D. ryukyuensis and sequenced and analyzed 8,988 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The ESTs were analyzed and grouped into 3,077 non-redundant sequences, leaving 1,929 singletons that formed the basis of unigene sets. Fifty-six percent of the cDNAs analyzed shared similarity (E-value<1E -20) with sequences deposited in NCBI. Highly redundant sequences encoded granulin and actin, which are expressed in the whole body, and other redundant sequences encoded a Vasa-like protein, which is known to be a component of germ-line cells and is expressed in the ovary, and Y-protein, which is expressed in the testis. The sexualized planarian expressed sequence tag database (http://planaria.bio.keio.ac.jp/planaria/) is an open-access, online resource providing access to sequence, classification, clustering, and annotation data. This database should constitute a powerful tool for analyzing sexualization in planarians.},

	abstract = {We explore and review the taxonomic distribution of morphological features that may be used as supporting apomorphies for the monophyletic status of various taxa in future, more comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the dendrocoelid freshwater planarians and their close relatives. Characters examined are: (i) musculature of the pharynx; (ii) anatomy of the eye; (iii) distribution of testis follicles along the longitudinal axis of the body; (iv) epidermis of the body wall; (v) musculature of the ventral body wall; (vi) presence or absence of a penis papilla; (vii) position of the mouth opening; and (viii) anterior adhesive organ. A phylogenetic hypothesis, in the form of a character state tree, is developed. This hypothesis suggests that the Kenkiidae should be resurrected as a separate family, sharing a sistergroup relationship with the Dendrocoelidae. This sistergroup relationship is supported by the shared presence of an apomorphic anterior adhesive organ. Although the shape of the anterior adhesive organ, both within and between kenkiids and dendrocoelids, may differ considerably between species, they are all constructed according to the same principles. The monophyly of the Kenkiidae is supported by the presence of an apomorphic thickening of the marginal zone of the epidermis and presumably also by the presence of prepharyngeal testes. Within the Kenkiidae, the genus Macrocotyla should be considered as a junior synonym of Kenkia, which is characterized by the presence of an apomorphic Ôplanariid pharynx-type 2Õ. The monophyly of the Dendrocoelidae is suggested by the presence of a dendrocoelid type of pharynx. It is shown that multicellular eye cups with numerous photoreceptor cells are not restricted to the Dugesiidae and the Terricola but are also characteristic for the Dendrocoelidae; the phylogenetic implications of this character state distribution are discussed. It is pointed out that in planarians there may be a relationship between: (i) body size, the size of an eye cup and the number of its constituent pigment cells; and (ii) the size of an eye cup and the number of photoreceptor cells that it contains. Some tentative phylogenetic groups are suggested on the basis of the following presumed apomorphic characters: presence of transverse fibres in the ventral subepidermal musculature, presence of an extra longitudinal muscle layer in the outer pharynx musculature, a mouth opening that has shifted anteriad. It is suggested that the presumed monophyly of the genus Bdellocephala is supported by the apomorphic absence of a penis papilla, combined with a penial lumen provided with many plicae.},

Nevertheless, studies on the structure of land flatworm communities are rare. In the present study, we investigated the terrestrial flatworm communities in two types of ombrophilous forest, Atlantic forest and Araucaria forest, aiming to answer the following questions: (1) Is the community structure of the two types of ombrophilous forest different? (2) Are there differences, regarding community structure, among distinct fragments of Araucaria forest? (3) Are there indicators of edge effects in these communities? The study site, the National Park of Aparados da Serra, is mainly covered, at high altitudes, by fragments of Araucaria forest immersed in a matrix of open areas (grasslands) and, in low altitudes, by a continuous Atlantic forest. We conducted monthly surveys in the two types of forest with three replications per forest type over a period of 2 years. Results indicated that: (1) community structure is clearly distinct between the two types of forest, as well as among fragments of the Araucaria forest; (2) there are no apparent edge effects; (3) the diversity indices of the two types of ombrophilous forest are not significantly different (Atlantic forest{\textemdash}H0 52.87, Araucaria forest{\textemdash}H0 52.55; p40.05); and (4) there are significant differences in diversity indices between two fragments of Araucaria forest (H0 52.92 and 2.47; po0.001). The following factors could affect community structure: type of vegetation, degree of human disturbance, and abiotic factors, such as pH and temperature.},

	abstract = {Summary Comparisons between invasive species and their relatives can help in identifying traits that facilitate dispersal and colonization, and comparisons among populations within invasive species may highlight the roles of plasticity and evolutionary adaptation. Bipalium adventitium Hyman 1943 is an exotic, earthworm-eating soil flatworm that has become widespread and abundant in North America. As a first step in better understanding the ecology and evolution of this invasive planarian, we studied its reproductive traits in populations across its extensive geographic range and conducted an experiment on the effects of food availability. Colonization by B. adventitium is facilitated by hermaphroditism, sperm storage, and tough egg capsules containing multiple offspring, traits present in most Terricola. The egg capsules produced by B. adventitium were large (22.5~mg), hatched in 7-37 days (mean=23 days), contained 1-8 offspring (mean=3.4), and represented about 21\% of a parent{\textquoteright}s predeposition mass. Many individuals produced multiple egg capsules. Although considerable intraspecific variation was detected for most reproductive parameters, significant differences among geographic populations were noted for egg capsule mass, mean offspring mass, and measures of total reproductive output. Intraspecific correlations between parent mass and the masses of egg capsules and offspring, and the results of our experiment showing that food availability affected egg capsule production, together suggest that thus far intra-population variation and plasticity have been more important than local evolutionary adaptation in the invasion of this species.},

The sequence data, consisting of 558 base positions in an aligned data set, were obtained by using the polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. For comparative analysis, the 18S rRNA gene sequence data on dendrocoelids from different distant geographical places (Europe, Lake Baikal in Siberia, Kamchatka) published previously were used. Such analysis showed that: (1) Bdellocephala species from Japan, Kamchatka and Lake Baikal are closely related ; (2) Japanese species classified within the genus Dendrocoelopsis do not form a single cluster of closely related organisms; (3) Dendrocoelopsis ichikawai differs minimally from Bdellocephala baicalensis (from Lake Baikal), reliably groups with all Bdellocephala, and should therefore be classed with this genus.

Taxonomic conclusions. (1) The genus Dendrocoelopsis should be revised after molecular typification of European and American representatives. (2) The current generic status of D. ichikawai based on the presence of a well-developed penis papilla should be reconsidered. (3) Sequence divergence amongst representatives of B. brunnea indicates that representatives should be closely examined for the presence of morphological characters by which they might be distinguished.},

A new endemic species from the Spanish Pyrenees, Microplana nana sp. nov. is described. The characteristic features of this species are: i) small size (8-10 mm) in adult individuals, ii) very long conical penis papilla and iii) absence of seminal vesicle, bursa copulatrix, genito-intestinal duct, and well developed penial bulb. Moreover, the widespread common European land planarian Microplana terrestris (M{\"u}ller, 1774) is reported for the first time from the Iberian Peninsula. The two species, M. nana sp. nov. and M. terrestris are described by means of external morphology, histological sections, and have been characterized using the ITS-1 molecular marker. The study of molecular markers such as ITS-1 is proposed as a powerful technique for identification at the species level in terrestrial planarians.

The distributional range of one group has a western accent, whereas that of the other group has an eastern emphasis; the ranges of these two groups overlap in Africa and the Mediterranean region. We attempt to determine the ancestral area for both the Dugesiidae and Dugesia. A scenario for the historical biogeography of the genus Dugesia is discussed.

	abstract = {The hermaphroditic flatworm, Polycelis nigra, is characterized by two reproductive biotypes which differ with respect to ploidy; sexual individuals are diploid (n = 8, 2{\texttimes} = 16) and pseudogamous parthenogenetic individuals are polyploid (typically 3{\texttimes}). We have collected and karyotyped individuals from 15 sampling sites (13 in mid to northern Italy, one in Great Britain and one in The Netherlands). We found that biotypes can exist alone or in sympatry, and identified purely diploid, mixed diploid-polyploid, and purely polyploid populations. Karyotype data show that in addition to the normal autosome complement, B chromosomes of differing morphology as well as stable aneuploid chromosomes (extra-A) were found almost exclusively in polyploids (11 of 12 sites). We extensively sampled Lago di Toblino (northern Italy), a pure polyploid population characterized by a submetacen- tric to metacentric, mitotically stable B chromosome, as well as a stable extra-A chromosome. Here, individuals having 1{\textendash}3 B chromosomes were more abundant (61\%) than those having no B{\textquoteright}s, implying that B chromosome infection has little detrimental effect when occurring in low numbers. Furthermore, 66\% of individuals from this population possessed extra-A chromosomes, although it is unclear whether these elements are aneuploid autosomes or B chromosomes of different morphology. The ubiquity of these chromosomes, within asexuals in particular, is suggestive of a correlation between the origination of the elements and the evolution of polyploidy, or may reflect increased tolerance of parthenogenetic genomes to aneuploidy.},

They have been described from many sexually reproducing species where they often exploit meiosis to accumulate from one generation to the next. Polycelis nigra is a simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworm that can reproduce either sexually or asexually through pseudogamous parthenogenesis: although individuals mate, the sperm is only used for egg activation but does not contribute genetically to the progeny. B chromosome frequencies were screened in populations from two North Italian lakes and found to vary from 27 to 90 per cent among pseudogamous parthenogenetic individuals. Because these frequencies were unexpectedly high for an asexual population, we looked at the transmission of B chromosomes in field-collected animals and controlled crosses. Animals that did not carry B chromosomes produced offspring with B chromosomes at frequencies of 6{\textendash}34 per cent. Results from the crosses strongly suggest that B chromosomes are not only inherited maternally, as expected, but also paternally. This is a new mode of inheritance for a B chromosome. By preventing expulsion from the egg, this B chromosome seems to have acquired biparental transmission in an otherwise asexually reproducing host. We discuss the evolutionary consequences of this observation in more detail.},

Microplana termitophaga is crepuscular with a large early morning and a smaller evening activity peak. Rainfall appears to be of over-riding importance; activity is confined to the rainy season, occurring once the cumulative rainfall reaches 150-250 mm and being suspended during longish dry spells. Activity is also favoured by ambient relative humidity above 70\%, light intensity below 50,000 lux (but not total darkness) and ambient temperature between 13 and 23d̀C. Planarians on sun-exposed, but not on shaded, mounds disappeared after a drought. Dispersal occurs during prolonged wet weather.

Microplana termitophaga occurs with two predatory spider species and a commensal phorid fly and they all utilize the same termites. These four species exhibit temporal separation, probably related to their specific micro-climatic needs.},

Dugesia subtentaculata has usually been regarded as a synonym of D. gonocephala, especially for its asexual races.

In order to assess the status of the two species, studies have been carried out on material from the surroundings of Montpellier, southern France, from which the type-material of the two species originated. It is concluded that both are valid taxa and neotypes have been designated. Dugesia gonocephala is the common European species, whereas D. subtentaculata has a specifically Mediterranean distribution. Dugesia iberica Gourbault \& Benazzi, 1979, originally described from Spain and Mallorca, is conspecific with this latter species.

The morphological and karyological characteristics of the two species and of several fissiparous races belonging to the subgenus Dugesia are discussed.},

Detailed field and laboratory studies of six of these have been made and a close correlation between seasonal variation in numbers and viability at different laboratory temperatures is demonstrated. Thus Spathula camara and Reynoldsonia reynoldsoni inhabit temporary habitats that experience wide temperature fluctuations and these two species survive equally well in the laboratory at a wide range of temperatures. In contrast Spathula tryssa appears stenothermal in habitat and in the laboratory cannot tolerate even a small temperature increase. Cura pinguis and Dugesia (Girardia) sp. also show wide temperature tolerance both in terms of abundance in the field and viability studies in the laboratory. Spathula agelaea sp. nov. is unusual in that it shows two annual peaks in abundance and also exhibits aggregatory and cannibalistic behaviour that may be involved in population regulation. Aspects of the distribution, abundance, and life cycle, of all the species are discussed in relation to what is known generally of planarian ecology.},

	abstract = {The results of several years of benthic research in Lake Tiberias are summed up. A provisional census of the invertebrate zoobenthos reveals a relatively reduced number of species. The widespread anoxyc conditions, the oligohaline salinity, and the stormy regime of the lake are held responsible for this reduction.

Five faunal belts are recognized in the benthal of the Lake: 1) the Supralittoral; 2) the Littoral; 3) the Sublittoral; 4) the Epiprofundal and 5) the Profundal. Seasonal changes occur chiefly in the littoral during the spring, and in the profundal during the winter.

The faunal history of the Lake is analysed, and the following phases are proposed: 1) the late Pliocene marine-brackish Bira lagoon; 2) the early Pleistocene freshwater Melanopsis lake; 3) the regressive Naharayim lake; 4) the interglacial, brackish Lissan I lake; 5) the glacial transgressive freshwater Lissan II lake. For the present postglacial stage, some man-made changes in the biological equilibrium are discussed.},

P. vivida was rather common in the cold-water stations within the altitude range from about 120 to 950 m or more. P. kawakatsui was found only in a spring-fed stream in Kameoka City (Asahi-cho; the type locality of this species) and in a shallow well at Saga-tenryuji-chd in Kyoto City. A small population of B. brunnea was found in a large spring-fed stream at Nishioji-sichijo in Kyoto City (the southernmost locality of this species). This station is well known to biologists as the locality of the sexual race of D. japonica (the Nishioji stock). The type of the vertical distribution in the area surveyed is shown as J-JV-V (J; D japonica; V: P vivida). The 2 species of true lake-dwelling tri-clads, BdellocepEala annandalci and Dendrocoelopsis? sp. of Lake Biwa-ko, were recorded from the muddy bottom (35 to 50 m or more in depth) of the middle and northern parts of Lake Biwa-ko.},

This paper records the results of a faunistic survey of the mountain streams of the Barberton area of the Eastern Transvaal. Sampling was carried out in five different biotopes; cascades, sprayed flanking regions, stickles, backwaters and pools.

Netting of the adults and imagos and breeding out of the larvae of Chironomidae, Odonata and Ephemeroptera was done.

The faunal affinities were assessed by a comparison of the mayfly fauna of this area with that reported in other surveys conducted in Africa.},

	abstract = {The vertical distribution of the freshwater planarians in the Teshio Mountains (the Uryu mountainous district) and its adjacent seaboard district on the Sea of Japan in central and North Hokkaido is reported. The Teshio Mountains are rather low mountains and the highest peak, Mt. Pissiri, is 1031.5 m above sea level. The seaboard district on the Sea of Japan consists of 2 topographical units, one is the low land (the district between Wakkanai and Rumoi) and the other is the Mashike mountainous district (the main peak, Mt. Shokanbetsudake, is 1491 m high). The area surveyed is situated in Latitude 43[degree]30{\textquoteright}N. to 45[degree]30{\textquoteright}N. and Longitude 141[degree]20{\textquoteright}E. to 142[degree]30{\textquoteright}E. The main river systems of the districts are the Ishikari, the Teshio and several short rivers (the Enbetsu, the Kotanbetsu, the Obirashibe and the Shokanbetsu). Surveys were made chiefly in the summers of 1962, 1963, 1964 and 1965. In the area surveyed, 9 spp. of freshwater planarians, Dugesia japonica Ichikawa et Kawakatsu, Phagocata vivida (Ijima et Kaburaki), Phagocata iwamai Ichikawa et Kawakatsu, Phagocata albata Ichikawa et Kawakatsu, Polycelis sapporo (Ijima et Kaburaki), Polycelis schmidti (Zabusov), Dendrocoelopsis lacteus Ichikawa et Okugawa, Dendrocoelopsis ezensis Ichikawa et Okugawa and Dendrocoelopsis sp. of Otoineppu, were found (including the data of Dr. Kawakatsu). P. sapporo was found everywhere in the streams and springs both in the seashore district and the stations below the altitude of about 460 m. P. schmidti was rather common in the cold-water localities in the Teshio Mountains and at Teshio-cho (alt 15-740 m). P. vivida was collected only in the cold-water spring at On{\textquoteright}nenai (the northernmost locality of this species). The other 6 spp. were found chifely in the localities in the plain. The inhabitable water temperature range of the main species of freshwater planarians is as follows: P. sapporo (6.2-18.3[degree]C); P. schmidti (7.0-10.2[degree]C). The type of vertical distribution in the area surveyed is JSC-SC-C. The geographical distribution of P. vivida, P. auriculata and P. schmidti in Hokkaido is also described (modifica-tion of the deduction of the Dr. Kawakatsu{\textquoteright}s 1965 article). The northern limit of distribution of P. vivida: the Oshima Peninsula-Sapporo-Mt. Teshio-the Shiretoko Peninsula. The northern limit of distribution of Polycelis auriculata: the Oshima Peninsula-Sapporo-Mt. Teshio-Kushiro. The southern limit of distribution of P. schmidti: Mt. Pisshiri-Mt. Teshio-Akan-the Shiretoko Peninsula.},

spring-fed swampy stream in Seekonk, Massachusetts. In vernal ponds the species is present during the winter
and spring and becomes sexually mature. The fully formed, stalkless egg capsules are retained in the body of
the parent worm for a period before being deposited. In vernal ponds in nature these egg capsules apparently
remain dormant during the summer and early autumn to hatch when water is again in the ponds in the late fall
or early winter. The capsules resist exptl. attempts to induce their hatching in the early weeks folowing
their deposit, but young worms emerge after a resting period of some 2 months or more. The species is
markedly protandrous, and in some morphological and ecological features shows similarities to spp. of
Phagocata and Curtisia.},

The four oils inhibited (P &lt; 0.05) nematode motility but Mentha spicata was generally more effective in reducing the numbers of active nematodes followed by Thymus vulgaris, Majorana hortensis and Mentha longifolia. The main corresponding compound of each oil, determined by GLC analysis, was carvone (58.14%), P-cymene (40.5%), terpinen-4-ol (41.6%) and carvone (70.36%). Soil stages of the reniform nematode were more affected by the oil than those of the ring and lance nematodes. When transferred to water, the total nematodes that regained their activeness ranged from 12% for T. vulgaris to 60% for M. longifolia. The four 0.1 oil solutions inhibited more than 80% of Meloidogyne incognita-juvenile hatching compared to about 3.5% at the control. The content of oxygenated compounds in these oils ranged from 45.79% to 96.5% and may be partially responsible for the nematicidal effects.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abousaber, M</author><author>Hadjakhoondi, A</author><author>Shafiee, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Composition of the essential oil of Thymus pubescens boiss. et Kotschy ex Celak and Thymus fedtschenkoi Ronniger from Iran</title><secondary-title>Journal of Essential Oil Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Essential Oil Research</full-title></periodical><pages>154-155</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><notes>PT: J</notes><research-notes>PT: J</research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus pubescens</label><abstract>Water-distilled essential oils from aerial parts of Thymus fedtschenkoi and Thymus pubescens collected from three different localities in Iran were analyzed by GC and GC/MS.

Thyme was cultivated in rows of 50 cm apart with inter-row spacing of 15, 30 or 45 cm and was grown at various development stages. Plants were harvested during different growth stages including vegetation, beginning of blooming, full blooming and fruit maturation. Results indicated that oil yields of thyme were affected by growth stage and inter-row spacing. The maximum oil yields was obtained by harvesting at the early growth stage, which was found superior to oil yield corresponding to the later stages of collection. With 45 cm inter-row spacing, the maximum oil yield was recorded when the samples were collected at growth stage. Indicated results showed that the chemical composition during various growth stages was characterised by high percentage of carvacrol and its corresponding monoterpenic hydrocarbon precursors rho-cymene and gamma-terpinene, and ether 1,4-cineol.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abu-Ghazaleh, B M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibition of Aeromonas caviae and A. sobria by sodium chloride, citric acid, ascorbic acid, potassium sorbate and extracts of Thymus vulgaris</title><secondary-title>Japanese journal of infectious diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Japanese journal of infectious diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>111-115</pages><volume>53; 53</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Department of Biology, Hashemite University, Zarqa, Jordan; Affiliation: P.O.Box 926966, Amman 11110, Jordan</pub-location><isbn>1344-6304</isbn><notes>        From Duplicate 2 (                           Inhibition of Aeromonas caviae and A. sobria by sodium chloride, citric acid, ascorbic acid, potassium sorbate and extracts of Thymus vulgaris                         - Abu-Ghazaleh, B M )

In eight of these species, seeds collected from several (2-9) populations were tested. Constant 15 degreesC, 20 degreesC, or 25 degreesC, and alternating 15/25 degreesC temperature regimes and 16/8 hours light/dark photoperiod conditions were used. In seeds from the different populations of Halopeplis amplexicaulis and Microcnemum coralloides, manual scarification, dry heat, and soaking in gibberellic acid solution were used as pretreatments applied for enhancing germination. Germination variables recorded were final germination percentage and germination rate (T,,). Incubation temperatures had a significant effect on the final germination percentage in five species, while germination rate was differentially affected by temperature in only two species. Significant differences among populations under the same temperature were detected for both germination percentage and germination rate in most of the species studied. In general, both final germination percentage and germination rate of H. amplexicaulis and M. coralloides were increased by the pretreatments assayed. In these two species, the highest germination percentages were reached by manual scarification.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alcazar, M D</author><author>Garcia, C</author><author>Rivera, D</author><author>Obon, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lesser-known herbal remedies as sold in the market at Murcia and Cartagena (Spain)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Ethnopharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Ethnopharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>243-247</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1990</year></dates><urls/><label>Thyme;Thymus L.</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aleksovski, S A</author><author>Sovova, H</author><author>Poposka, F A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extraction of thyme oil: Comparison between hydrodistillation and supercritical CO2 extraction</title><secondary-title>Acta Pharmaceutica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Pharmaceutica</full-title></periodical><pages>305-310</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Carvacrol</keyword><keyword>Essential oil</keyword><keyword>Hydrodistillation</keyword><keyword>L.

The SFE extraction was performed in a semibatch apparatus and the rate of extraction was found dependent on the extraction pressure and temperature and on the amount of carbon dioxide passed through the extractor. The most suitable conditions for the extraction were 11 MPa and 50°C. The compounds extracted by both SFE and HD were identified by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The difference in the aroma of the products was quite noticeable and can be attributed to qualitative and quantitative differences in the extracts and hydrodistillates. Predominance of aromatic alcohols carvacrol and thymol and their biosynthetic precursors p-cymene and γ-terpinene was revealed in both SFE extracts and HD oil. The SFE extracts also contained water and cuticular waxes; longer extraction times and higher pressures resulted in a higher percentage of water and waxes in the extract.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amarowicz, R</author><author>Żegarska, Z</author><author>Rafałowski, R</author><author>Pegg, B R</author><author>Karamać, M</author><author>Kosińska, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antioxidant activity and free radical-scavenging capacity of ethanolic extracts of thyme, oregano, and marjoram</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>1117</pages><volume>111</volume><keywords><keyword>Essential oils</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Moreover, the efficacies of the prepared herb extracts were investigated in a real-life food product: the stabilization of butter against oxidation.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amiot, J</author><author>Salmon, Y</author><author>Collin, C</author><author>Thompson, J D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential resistance to freezing and spatial distribution in a chemically polymorphic plant Thymus vulgaris</title><secondary-title>Ecology Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecology Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>370-377</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><notes>PT: J</notes><research-notes>PT: J</research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>Secondary compounds play multiple ecological roles. In this study, we present novel experimental evidence of differential tolerance to freezing temperatures among chemotypes of a chemically polymorphic plant, Thymus vulgaris. Non-phenolic chemotypes showed a significantly better survival and re-growth after early-winter freezing (-10 degrees in early December) than phenolic chemotypes. Comparison of temperature data (1971-2002) at a phenolic and non-phenolic site showed that whereas early-winter freezing occurred in 6 years in the non-phenolic site they never occurred at the phenolic site. Observations of trichome morphology (where the essential oil is stocked) with and without intense freezing indicate that non-phenolic chemotypes may escape any negative effects of freezing by releasing their essential oil into the atmosphere during severe freezing. The correlation between tolerance of freezing and local temperature regimes strongly suggests that differential freezing resistance is a key ingredient of the distribution of thyme chemotypes in space.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Andrews, A C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thyme as a Condiment in the Graeco-Roman Era</title><secondary-title>Osiris</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Osiris</full-title></periodical><pages>150-156</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>1958</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Andrews - Thyme as a Condiment in the Graeco-Roman Era.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Thyme;Thymus L.;Thymus serpyllum;Thymus sibthorpii;Thymus vulgaris</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Angelini, Luciana G.</author><author>Carpanese, Giovanna</author><author>Cioni, Pier Luigi</author><author>Morelli, Ivano</author><author>Macchia, Mario</author><author>Flamini, Guido</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Essential oils from Mediterranean lamiaceae as weed germination inhibitors</title><secondary-title>Journal of agricultural and food chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of agricultural and food chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>6158-6164</pages><volume>51; 51</volume><issue>21; 21</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2003</year></dates><isbn>0021-8561</isbn><notes>        From Duplicate 1 (                           Essential oils from Mediterranean lamiaceae as weed germination inhibitors                         - Macchia, Mario; Flamini, Guido; Angelini, LucianaG G; Carpanese, Giovanna; Cioni, PierLuigi L; Morelli, Ivano )

The essential oil composition varied with the species, thymol being the main constituent (44%) of thyme and carvacrol (57%) that of savory oil. Differences in essential oil composition were observed within two different rosemary ecotypes, type A, with alpha-pinene (37%) and 1,8-cineole (23%), and type B, characterized by a 2-fold content of 1,8-cineole (47%). This latest essential oil inhibited completely the germination of weeds while concurrently displaying little effect on pepper. The other two oils showed less selective action. S. montana essential oil, with 57% carvacrol, is the most active compound, completely inhibiting germination both of crops and weeds. Borneol, one of the main constituents of the oil of rosemary type B, showed an activity comparable to that of the whole oil. Crop and weed seeds treated with 1,8-cineole showed germination values that were not significantly different from controls, even if a slowing of the germination process expressed in terms of a significant increase in mean germination time was observed. Monoterpene compounds also present in the essential oils mainly represented the volatile fraction released from the crops and their residues into the soil</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arminante, F</author><author>DeFalco, E</author><author>DeFeo, V</author><author>DeMartino, L</author><author>Mancini, E</author><author>Quaranta, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Allelopathic activity of essential oils from Mediterranean Labiatae</title><secondary-title>Acta Horticulturae</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Horticulturae</full-title></periodical><pages>347-352</pages><volume>723</volume><keywords><keyword>Allelopathy</keyword><keyword>Antigerminative activity</keyword><keyword>Monoterpenes</keyword><keyword>Natural herbicides</keyword><keyword>Volatile compounds</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, Università degli Studi di Salerno, Via Ponte don Melillo, 84084 Fisciano (Salerno), Italy</pub-location><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-33846041723&amp;partnerID=40&amp;rel=R6.5.0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>There is a great incentive to discover effective and economically feasible herbicides that are toxicologically and environmentally benign, to replace pesticides that have been withdrawn for regulatory reasons or are ineffective, due to the increasing difficult of managing pest resistance. The study of the physiological role of natural products in biochemical interactions among plants can supply new active compounds and/or models for new mechanisms of action. Volatile terpenes and essential oils have been reported as regulators of germination and growth of other species in several ecosystem. In this study we have carried out a chemical and biological evaluation of the essential oils from eight Mediterranean Labiatae in order to characterize their composition and to verify their potential activities in vitro on growth and development of three test seeds. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation from Hyssopus officinalis L., Lavandula angustifolia Miller, Majorana hortensis L., Melissa officinalis L., Ocimum basilicum L., Origanum vulgare L., Salvia officinalis L., and Thymus vulgaris L. and their chemical composition was achieved by GC and GC/MS methods. The essential oils have been assayed against the germination and the successive radical growth of Raphanus sativus L., Lactuca sativa L. and Lepidium sativum L. The assayed essential oils have shown a good inhibitory avctivity in a dose-dependent way, both on germination and radical elongation of three test species. Our study has shown a positive correlation between the total monoterpene content in the essential oils and the inhibitory activity.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arraiza, M P</author><author>Andrés, M R</author><author>Arrabal, C</author><author>López, J V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal variation of essential oil yield and composition of thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) grown in Castilla-La Mancha (Central Spain).</title><secondary-title>Journal of Essential Oil Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Essential Oil Research</full-title></periodical><pages>360-362</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Allured Publishing Corporation</publisher><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arrebola, M L</author><author>Navarro, M C</author><author>Jiménez, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Essential Oils from Satureja obovata, Thymus serpylloides subsp. serpylloides and T. serpylloides subsp. gadorensis Micropropagated Plants</title><secondary-title>Journal of Essential Oil Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Essential Oil Research</full-title></periodical><pages>533-536</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Camphor</keyword><keyword>Carvacrol</keyword><keyword>Essential oil composition</keyword><keyword>Essential oils</keyword><keyword>Isocaryophyllene</keyword><keyword>Lamiaceae</keyword><keyword>Linalool</keyword><keyword>Micropropagated plants</keyword><keyword>Satureja obovata</keyword><keyword>T. serpylloides subsp. gadorensis</keyword><keyword>Thymus serpylloides subsp. serpylloides</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Departamento de Biologia Vegetal, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad de Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain; Affiliation: Departamento de Farmacología, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad de Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain; Affiliation: Division of Pha</pub-location><notes>Cited By (since 1996): 1</notes><research-notes>Cited By (since 1996): 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-0008092945&amp;partnerID=40&amp;rel=R6.5.0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus serpylloides</label><abstract>Essential oils of micropropagated Satureja obovala Lag., Thymus serpylloides Bory subsp. serpylloides and T. serpylloides Bory subsp. gadorensis (Pau) Jalas plants (Lamiaceae) have been studied by GC and GC/MS.

Thyme volatile phenolic oil has been reported to be among the top 10 essential oils, showing antibacterial, antimycotic, antioxidative, natural food preservative, and mammalian age delaying properties. It has been known that agronomical factors have a great effect on both quality and quantity of essential metabolites. For this reason, it is necessary to determine optimum levels of agronomical factors affecting plant growth and production. Planting space and time of harvesting are the most important agronomical factors. This study has been conducted in Research farm of ACECR, Institute of Medicinal Plants &amp; Natural Products Research along 1999-2000 on the base of factorial experiment in randomized complete block design with three replications. Thyme is cultivated in rows of 50 cm apart with inter-row spacing of 15, 30 or 45 cm. Plants are harvested in three stages, i.e. the beginning of blooming, full blooming and fruit set. In order to study the effects of plants space and time of harvesting, plant height, plant diameter, yields of dry and fresh herbage, content (%) and yield of oil, thymol and carvacrol were measured. Planting space had significant effect on plant diameter (P &lt; 0.05) and very significant effect (P &lt; 0.01) on other measured parameters except oil content, which was not significant. Time of harvest had significant effect on yield of fresh herbage, content of oil and content of carvacrol (P &lt; 0.05). Its effect on other parameters was very significant (P &lt; 0.01) except dry herbage and oil yield. The maximum yield of dry and fresh herbage, yield and content of oil and thymol yield were obtained in 15 cm space and beginning of blooming stage. Maximum thymol content was observed in the beginning of blooming and 45 cm space. However, 15 cm spacing and harvesting in the beginning of blooming was the best treatment in respect of yield of dry matter, oil and thymol per unit area.

Different levels of fertilizers (N = 0, 45, 90, and 135 kg ha(-1)) were applied. It was found that fortilizers increase thyme crop, but differences in the yield of essential oil were not remarkable. However, the use of certain amounts of nitrogen fertilizers resulted in higher yields of essential oil obtainable from the cultivation area unit (dm(3) ha(-1)). Totally, 61 constituents were identified in thyme essential oil by capillary GC and GC-MS. Thymol was the dominating compound in the all analyzed oils (44.4-58.1 %), followed by p-cymene (9.1-18.5%), gamma-terpinene (6.9-18.9%), and carvacrol (2.4-4.2%). Differences in the percentage of these and other compounds in thyme herb cultivated under different fertilization doses were not significant; very slight changes in the percentage composition were detected after drying. Some variations in the amount of individual constituents expressed in arbitrary units per kilogram of herb (which is almost equivalent to mg kg(-1)) were observed. The highest amounts of sugars and sucrose, in particular, were determined in the second year of thyme cultivation. Differences in the content of dry soluble substances were not meaningful, and there was no effect of nitrogen fertilizers on this chemical characteristic. Some effect of fertilization on the content of vitamin C and carotenes was observed in the first year of thyme cultivation. It was determined that nitrogen fertilizers influence the amount of nitrates, which was highest in the second-year-first-harvest.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barazandeh, M M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Essential oil composition of Thymus fallax Fisch.et C.A.

Chemical diversity among the flowering plants of Turkey is well documented in the recently published volume 11 of the Flora of Turkey and the East Aegean Islands. Among the aromatic taxa, remarkable examples can be found in families such as Labiatae, Compositae, Umbelliferae, etc. The occurrence of volatile chemicals in aromatic plants is not only an indication of chemical diversity but may also help solve taxonomical problems is comprehensively studied genera. Aromatic diversity is illustrated with examples from genera such as Sideritis, Salvia, Thymus, Origanum, Satureja, Thymbra, Mentha, Micromeria, Ziziphora, Calamintha, Cyclotrichium, Acinos, Echinophora, Ferulago, Heracleum, Pimpinella, Tanacetum, and Betula. The economic implications of aromatic biodiversity and the importance of bioprospecting are highlighted.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baser, K H C</author><author>Demirci, B</author><author>Kirimer, N</author><author>Satil, F</author><author>Tumen, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The essential oils of Thymus migricus and T. fedtschenkoi var. handelii from Turkey</title><secondary-title>Flavour and Fragrance Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Flavour and Fragrance Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>41-45</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Carvacrol</keyword><keyword>Essential oil</keyword><keyword>Lamiaceae</keyword><keyword>Linalool</keyword><keyword>Thymol</keyword><keyword>Thymus fedtschenkoi var. handelii</keyword><keyword>Thymus migricus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Anadolu University, Medicinal and Aromatic Plant, Drug Research Centre TBAM, 26470 Eskişehir, Turkey</pub-location><notes>        From Duplicate 1 (                           The essential oils of Thymus migricus and T. fedtschenkoi var. handelii from Turkey                         - Başer, K H C; Demirci, B; Kirimer, N; Satil, F; Tümen, G )

These herbs belong to the Lamiaceae (Labiatae) family which comprises other plants such as hyssop (Hyssopus officinalis), basil (Ocimum basilicum), marjoram (Origanum majorana), mint (Mentha piperita), sage (Salvia officinalis) and lavender (Lavandula officinalis). Objective: We describe three systemic allergic reactions caused by oregano and thyme in the same patient. Methods: Skin tests with inhalant allergens and plants of the Labiatae family were done. We used the prick by prick technique with dried commercial plants and prick tests with extracts prepared with the Frugoni method in our patient and in ten control patients. Total serum IgE was determined by Phadezym IgE PRIST (Pharmacia). Specific IgE was measured by two methods: CAP system (Pharmacia) and Phadezym PAST (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden) with activated discs of the allergenic extracts that were prepared in our laboratory. Results: Skin tests with inhalants were positive to grasses. Skin tests with plants of the Labiatae family were positive in all cases when the skin prick technique was used; tests were negative with basil and lavender, and positive with all the others when we used the prick by prick technique. We did not detect any positive skin tests nor specific IgE to plants of the Labiatae family in control patients. Total serum IgE was 406 U/mL. Specific IgE was detected to all herbs tested; higher levels were obtained with the CAP system. Conclusions: Plants belonging to the Labiatae family seem to show cross-sensitivity on the basis of clinical history and in vitro and in vivo test results.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berdowska, I</author><author>Marcinkowska, A</author><author>Zieliński, B</author><author>Fecka, I</author><author>Banaś, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effect of selected herb extracts on superoxide dismutase activity in Jurkat cells</title><secondary-title>Advances in Clinical and Experimental Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Clinical and Experimental Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>361-364</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Jurkat cells</keyword><keyword>Lamiaceae herbs</keyword><keyword>Polyphenols</keyword><keyword>Superoxide dismutase</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Department of Medical Biochemistry, Silesian Piasts University of Medicine, Chalubińskiego 10, 50-368 Wrocław, Poland; Affiliation: Department of Pharmacognosy, Silesian Piasts University of Medicine, Chalubińskiego 10, 50-368 Wrocław, Pola</pub-location><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-34547133502&amp;partnerID=40&amp;rel=R6.5.0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus serpyllum;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>Background: Numerous dietary and medicinal herbs containing high levels of polyphenolic compounds exert antioxidative properties which are beneficial in the prophylaxis of many diseases, including cancer and atherosclerosis. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an enzyme scavenging superoxide radicals. It is hypothesized that some antioxidative effects of polyphenols may occur through interaction with this enzyme. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the influence of polyphenolic herb extracts on SOD activity in human leukemia cells. Material and Methods: Aqueous extracts comtaining polyphenolic fractions were prepared from Thymus serpyllum (Ts), Thymus vulgaris (Tv), Majorana hortensis (Mh), and Mentha piperita (Mp). The experiments were conducted on human Jurkat cells, which were exposed to the Ts, Tv, Mh, or Mp polyphenolic fractions at concentrations of 10-500 μg/ml for 0.5, 1, or 2 hours. SOD activity was measured spectrophotometrically using a modified RANSOD kit protocol. The results were analyzed using the Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) design in Statistica version 6 software. All effects were regarded as significant at a significance level of p &lt; 0.05. Results: The analysis of the results suggests a stimulatory effect of the extracts which was most evident at shorter incubation times (0.5 and 1 hour) and at concentrations of 50 and 500 μg/ml. However, in the case of Ts and Mh, 2-hour incubation at the highest concentration (500 μg/ml) also resulted in a significant increase in enzymatic activity. In contrast, the lowest concentration of the extracts (10 μg/ml) exhibited no significant effect on SOD. Conclusions: The stimulation of SOD activity in Jurkat cells under the influence of Lamiaceae herb polyphenolic fractions suggests that some antioxidative effects of polyphenols may result from direct interaction with the free radical-scavenging enzyme. © Copyright by Silesian Piasts University of Medicine in Wrocław.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Biondi, D</author><author>Cianci, P</author><author>Geraci, C</author><author>Ruberto, G*</author><author>Piattelli, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of essential oils from Sicilian aromatic plants</title><secondary-title>Flavour and Fragrance Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Flavour and Fragrance Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>331-337</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Antibacterial activity</keyword><keyword>Antifungal activity</keyword><keyword>Bactericidal activity</keyword><keyword>Bacteriostatic activity</keyword><keyword>Essential oil composition</keyword><keyword>GC-MS</keyword><keyword>Lamiaceae (Labiatae)</keyword><keyword>Lauraceae</keyword><keyword>Laurus nobilis L</keyword><keyword>Oregano</keyword><keyword>Origanum onites L</keyword><keyword>Phenols</keyword><keyword>Sage</keyword><keyword>Thymus capitatus Hoffmanns et Link</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1993</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Ist CNR per lo Studio delle Sostanze, Naturali di Interesse Alimentare e, Chimico-Farmaceutico, Viadel Santuario 110, I-95028 Valverde, Italy</pub-location><isbn>0882-5734</isbn><notes>        From Duplicate 2 (                           Antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of essential oils from Sicilian aromatic plants                         - Biondi, D; Cianci, P; Geraci, C; Ruberto, G; Piattelli, M )

Ronn., emend. Jalas, collected at 16 localities in the Austrian and Italian Alps (Tyrol and South Tyrol), were investigated concerning their composition and the variations therein. In total, 60 components, almost exclusively monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, were identified by GC and GC-MS. The patterns of the oils were processed by means of multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) including factor analysis (FA), cluster analysis (CA) and discriminant analysis (DA). The most plausible result, revealing 12 clusters, was obtained by a modified CA method based on the average linkage method with the Pearson correlation. Considering all other statistical results obtained, 12 oil types became evident with the following type-characterising compounds: thymol, geraniol/geranyl acetate, trans-sabinene hydrate/terpinen-4-ol, α-terpineol, linalol, linalol/linalyl acetate, borneol, trans-nerolidol, hedycaryol, T-cadinol, germacra-1(10),5-dien-4-ol, and germacra-1(10),4-dien-6-ol. All these oil types have been found before in other Thymus species. The thymol type, found for 46 samples, represented the most dominant oil type. The chemical similarity with Mediterranean and North Atlantic Thymus species indicates a mixing of southern and northern elements in the Alps, which is also reflected in the overlapping morphological characters of T. praecox ssp. polytrichus.

(common thyme) is an aromatic, medicinal and spice plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. Its aerial parts are considered to have bronchospasmolytic, expectorant and antibacterial effects and because of that they are common ingredient of the cough and bronchial teas and other phytopreparations. Thymus pulegioides L. (large wild thyme) has been often united with T. serpyllum, but Flora Europaea clearly distinguishes these two species. The aim of this comparative study was to determine morphological, anatomical and phytochemical features required for the differentiation and identity proof of T. vulgaris and T. pulegioides. Based on different morphological features, the leaves in toto of T. vulgaris and T. pulegioides can be easily distinguished. Comparative anatomical analysis showed that T. vulgaris has a stem pubescent all round while the stem of T. pulegioides is hairy on the angles only. On the lower surface of the thyme leaf there are characteristic warty bicellular (or tricellular) elbow-shaped covering trichomes, absent in T. pulegioides. Furthermore, long multicellular covering trichomes were only found on the base of T. pulegioides leaf. Thin-layer chromatography of leaf extracts revealed the presence of flavonoids, phenolic acids and monoterpenoid phenols. Characteristic features of chromatograms of flavonoids as chemotaxonomic markers enable simple and reliable identification of Thymus species studied and their preparations as well. Finally, quantitative analysis showed that the contents of total flavonoids in the leaves of T. vulgaris and T. pulegioides were 0,06% and 0,10% respectivelly.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blazquez, M A</author><author>Manez, S</author><author>Zafrapolo, M C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Further Flavonoids and Other Phenolics of Thymus webbianus Rouy</title><secondary-title>Zeitschrift Fur Naturforschung C-a Journal of Biosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zeitschrift Fur Naturforschung C-a Journal of Biosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>687-688</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>9-10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1994</year></dates><notes>PT: J</notes><research-notes>PT: J</research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus webbianus</label><abstract>Seven different flavonoids from the aerial parts of Thymus webbianus were isolated.

The chemical composition was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The main components of the essential oils were carvacrol (62-83%), p-cymene (5-17%), γ-terpinene (2-14%) and β-caryophyllene (1-4%). The antioxidant activity of the oils (100-1000 mg l-1) was assessed by measurement of metal chelating activity, the reductive potential, the free radical scavenging (DPPH) and by the TBARS assay. The antioxidant activity was compared with that of synthetic antioxidants: butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Both the essential oils and BHA and BHT showed no metal chelating activity. Although with the other methodologies, there was a general increase in the antioxidant activity, with increasing oil concentration, maxima being obtained in the range of 500 and 1000 mg l-1 for flowering and post-flowering phase oils. Major differences were obtained according to the methodology of antioxidant capacity evaluation. Antibacterial ability of Th. capitatus essential oils was tested by disc agar diffusion against Bacillus cereus, Salmonella sp., Listeria innocua, four different strains of Staphylococus aureus (C15, ATCC25923, CFSA-2) and a multi-resistant form of S. aureus (MRSA-2). Antibacterial properties were compared to synthetic antibiotics. Higher antibacterial activity was observed with the flowering and the post-flowering phase essential oils. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Populations for each species were collected from different bioclimatically zones. A high genetic variation within the populations of each species was revealed. The genotypic richness of populations before their fragmentation and the high rate of outcrossing were the main contributing factors in this high variation. Differentiation among populations was substantial for each species. Only Rosmarinus officinalis showed a significant relationship between population structure and geographic distance. Differentiation between contiguous bioclimates was less important than that recorded between discontinuous ones. Intraspecific populations genetic similarity was high. The low genetic divergence between populations and their substantial structure indicate their recent fragmentation under anthropic pressures. Implications of genetic and population structure for the development of in situ and ex situ conservation strategies are discussed. Conclusions could be applied for other lamiaceae species.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bouzouita, N</author><author>Kachouri, F</author><author>Hamdi, M</author><author>Chaabouni, M M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Tunisian aromatic plants</title><secondary-title>Flavour and Fragrance Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Flavour and Fragrance Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>380-383</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2003</year></dates><notes>PT: J</notes><research-notes>PT: J</research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus capitatus</label><abstract>The essential oils from Thymus capitatus (L.)

The antioxidant activity was evaluated as a free radical scavenging capacity (RSC), together with effects on lipid peroxidation (LP). RSC was assessed measuring the scavenging activity of the essential oils on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil (DPPH) and OH radicals. Effects on LP were evaluated following the activities of essential oils in Fe2+/ascorbate and Fe2+/H2O2 systems of induction. Essential oils exhibited very strong RSCs, reducing the DPPH radical formation (IC50) in the range from 0.17 (oregano) to 0.39 g/mL (basil). The essential oil of T. vulgaris exhibited the highest OH radical scavenging activity, although none of the examined essential oils reached 50% of neutralization (IC50). All of the tested essential oils strongly inhibited LP, induced either by Fe2+/ascorbate or by Fe2+/H2O2. The antimicrobial activity was tested against 13 bacterial strains and six fungi. The most effective antibacterial activity was expressed by the essential oil of oregano, even on multiresistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli.

DNA sequence data from three regions (chloroplast: trnK intron; trnL-F; nuclear: ITS) in total including 278 accessions, representing 38 out of 40 genera of subtribe Menthinae and 11 outgroup genera, were used to reconstruct the evolutionary history, test previous hypotheses of classification, explain biogeographic patterns and elucidate character evolution. Using maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian analysis phylogenetic reconstructions based on nuclear and chloroplast sequence data were incongruent, consequently the data were analyzed separately. Both nuclear and chloroplast datasets provide strong support for three major lineages: the &quot;Satureja&quot;, &quot;Micromeria&quot; and &quot;Clinopodium&quot; group. The first contains members of Satureja and Gontscharovia. In the second lineage Micromeria s.str. and Origanum were resolved as monophyletic, Pentapleura and Zataria indicated as sister groups. Thymbra includes two species of Satureja turning the latter genus polyphyletic. Thymus is revealed as paraphyletic with respect to Argantoniella and Saccocalyx in both and Origanum in the plastid dataset only. In the third lineage, the Clinopodium-group, branching pattern is highly incongruent among datasets and possibly influenced by recent and ancient hybridization, chloroplast capture and incomplete lineage sorting. However, identical terminal groups are inferred in both analyses. A Madagascan lineage of &quot;Micromeria&quot;, sister to the recently described South African Killickia, is suggested to represent a new genus. The Himalayan Clinopodium nepalense group and the tropical African C. abyssinicum alliance are monophyletic but indicated in different positions. Both groups appear in the ITS phylogeny in a clade with Cyclotrichium and Mentha, relationships not suggested previously. The enigmatic Micromeria cymuligera is close to Mentha and possibly is a representative of this genus. Species of Acinos, now regarded as part of Clinopodium, are mixed up with species of Ziziphora, questioning either the inclusion of Acinos in Clinopodium or generic distinctness of Ziziphora. All data sets suggest a monophyly of the New World taxa and argue for long distance dispersal from the Old World, rather than a vicariance explanation. Bystropogon marks the split up between the two lineages. Inclusion of 22 genera intermixed with Clinopodium spp. in the New World clade provides evidence that the current circumscription of the genus is highly unnatural. Low sequence divergence resulting in low phylogenetic resolution especially at the base of the clade indicate a rapid radiation accompanied by considerable ecological diversification and speciation.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bruni, A</author><author>Modenesi, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development, oil storage and dehiscence of peltate trichomes in Thymus vulgaris (Lamiaceae)</title><secondary-title>Pubblicazioni dell'Istituto botanico &quot;Hanbury&quot; dell'Università di Genova ;; n. 271</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pubblicazioni dell'Istituto botanico &quot;Hanbury&quot; dell'Università di Genova ;; n. 271</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Thymus vulgaris -- Morphology</keyword><keyword>Trichomes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1983</year></dates><pub-location>Genova</pub-location><publisher>Istituto botanico &quot;Hanbury&quot; dell'Università di Genova</publisher><notes>p. 245-251 : ill. ; 27 cm.; Note(s): Caption title./ Series statement stamped on caption page./ Reprinted from &quot;Nordic journal of botany 3 (2) 1983.&quot;/ Includes bibliographical references (p. 251).; Responsibility: Alessandro Bruni and Paolo Modenesi.; Entry: 20060530; Update: 20060530

'In vitro' leaves were obtained through organ culture, whereas wild material - 'in vivo' leaves - was collectd in Lanjaron (Granada, Espana). Both samples showed similar oil-glands, which resembled the general pattern in Labiatae; however, we noticed remarkable differences as far as shape and hairs were concerned. These facts are thought to be caused by the environment: cultured plants grow in optimum conditions, so they do not develop their defensive mechanism as much as wild plants do. These conclusions are reinforced by the study of powdered leaves.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Calcuttawalla, A I</author><author>Pandita, N S</author><author>Bhatt, R M</author><author>Vaidya, A D B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antibacterial activity, HPTLC and GLC studies of volatiles of Thymus vulgaris</title><secondary-title>Indian Drugs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Indian Drugs</full-title></periodical><pages>41</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Bhavans Swami Prakashananda Ayurveda, Research Centre, 13th North-South Road, Juhu, Mumbai 400 049, India</pub-location><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-0036229010&amp;partnerID=40&amp;rel=R6.5.0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>Essential oil of Thymus vulgaris (Linn.

These essential oils were then used in two concentrations (0.05% and 0.1%) in refined olive oil in 6 trials and a control to study the antioxidant properties. The antioxidant activity of the essential oils was followed up by the determination of the peroxide value and the acid value of the olive oil over a period of 6 months. Sensory evaluations of the trials were also conducted by a taste panel of 6 assessors for an organoleptic assessment. Results showed a wide variation in the antioxidant activity of the three oils, and also a slight variation between the two concentrations was observed. The highest activity was observed with thyme oil followed by oregano oil, while an organoleptic quality improvement was obtained with the oregano and lemon oils. © 1999 Allured Publishing Corp.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chorianopoulos, N</author><author>Kalpoutzakis, E</author><author>Aligiannis, N</author><author>Mitaku, S</author><author>Nychas, G J</author><author>Haroutounian, S A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Essential oils of Satureja, Origanum, and Thymus species: chemical composition and antibacterial activities against foodborne pathogens</title><secondary-title>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>8261-8267</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>26</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><publisher>ACS Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/jf049113i</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus longicaulis</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cognitas, Plantas Rite</author><author>Sexualr, Ststema</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SPECIES</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Cognitas, Sexualr - SPECIES.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Colin, M E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Essential oils of Labiatae for controlling honey bee varroosis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Entomology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Entomology</full-title></periodical><pages>19-25</pages><volume>110</volume><issue>1; 1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1990</year></dates><isbn>0931-2048</isbn><urls><web-urls><url>http://muse.lib.auth.gr:9797/com/csa/?MuseHost=www-mi2.csa.com&amp;MuseFirst=1&amp;id=2&amp;recnum=6&amp;SID=55360d1a6858ae31d3e80acbc52d3e6b&amp;MusePath=/ids70/view_record.php</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>The efficiency of Labiatae essential oils was compared with a classical aerosol treatment, including the acaricidic substance amitraz at the 0.25 concentration.

These products were also injected into each colony by the aerosol way for one minute. 4 applications in an interval of 3 or 4 cays constitute the treatment. The dead mites (Varroa jacobsoni Oud.) were counted everyday. The number of surviving mites was estimated by means of a fluvalinate control treatment.

In this work the chemical composition and the antimicrobial properties of Thymus essential oils and of their main components were determined. Three essential oils obtained from different species of Thymus growing wild in Sardinia and a commercial sample of Thymus capitatus oil were analysed. The essential oil components were identified by GC/MS analysis. The antimicrobial activity of the oils and components was determined against a panel of standard reference strains and multiple strains of food-derived spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, using a broth microdilution method. The GC/MS analysis showed that the major constituents of the oils were monoterpene hydrocarbons and phenolic monoterpenes, but the concentration of these compounds varied greatly among the oils examined. The results of the antimicrobial assay showed that essential oils extracted from Sardinian Thymus species have an antimicrobial activity comparable to the one observed in other thyme oils. It seems also confirmed that the antimicrobial properties of thyme essential oils are mainly related to their high phenolic content. Among the single compounds tested carvacrol and thymol turned out to be the most efficient against both reference strains and food-derived bacteria. The results of this study confirmed the possibility of using thyme essential oils or some of their components in food systems to prevent the growth of foodborne bacteria and extend the shelf-life of processed foods.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Couladis, M</author><author>Tzakou, O</author><author>Kujundzic, S</author><author>Sokovic, M</author><author>Mimica-Dukic, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chemical Analysis and Antifungal Activity of Thymus striatus</title><secondary-title>Phytotherapy Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Phytotherapy Research</full-title></periodical><pages>40-42</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Antifungal activity</keyword><keyword>Essential oil</keyword><keyword>P-cymene</keyword><keyword>Thymol</keyword><keyword>Thymus striatus</keyword><keyword>α-terpinene</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: School of Pharmacy, Dept.

We evaluated the influence of five essential oils obtained from plant species which are known to have positive antimicrobial, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects - sage EO from Salvia officinalis L. (Lamiaceae), oregano EO from Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae), thyme EO from Thymus vulgaris L. (Lamiaceae), clove EO from Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) and cinnamon EO from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae) on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo. Essential oils were added to commercial diet at concentrations of 0.25 % for sage EO, thyme EO, clove EO, cinnamon EO and 0.1 % for oregano EO, and fed to ICR female mice for 2 weeks ad libitum. Females were then mated with males of the same strain. Embryos obtained on Day 4 of pregnancy at the blastocyst stage were stained by morphological triple staining (Hoechst, PI, Calcein-AM) and evaluated using fluorescent microscopy. The effects of essential oils were estimated by the viability of embryos, number of nuclei and distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Cinnamon EO significantly decreased the number of nuclei and the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number was significantly altered. Sage EO negatively influenced the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Clove and oregano EOs induced a significantly increased rate of cell death. Only thyme EO had no detectable effects on embryo development. In conclusion, none of the essential oils had any positive effect on embryo development, but some of them reduced the number of cells and increased the incidence of cell death. © 2007 Institute of Physiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dommée, B</author><author>Assouad, M W</author><author>Valdeyron, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Natural selection and gynodioecy in Thymus vulgaris L.</title><secondary-title>Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society</full-title></periodical><pages>17-28</pages><volume>77</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1978</year></dates><publisher>Wiley Online Library</publisher><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dorman, H J D</author><author>Deans, S G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antimicrobial agents from plants: antibacterial activity of plant volatile oils</title><secondary-title>Journal of applied microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of applied microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>308-316</pages><volume>88</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><notes>PT: J</notes><research-notes>PT: J</research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>The volatile oils of black pepper [Piper nigrum L.

Various experimental models were used for the characterisation of the activity, including iron reduction capacity, DPPH., ABTS.(+) and .OH radical-scavenging activities and the capacity of the extracts to inhibit copper-induced oxidation of human low-density lipoproteins (LDL) ex vivo. The extracts showed varying degrees of reductive and radical scavenging capacity, and were capable of a marked prolongation of the lag-time in the LDL oxidation assay. The hierarchy of the observed antioxidant activity of the extracts was dependent on the type of assay used. The observed antioxidant characteristics were not fully related to the total phenolic contents of the extracts in any of the assays, but were presumably strongly dependent on rosmarinic acid, the major phenolic component present in this type of Lamiaceae extract.

The aromatic plant Thymus vulgaris has the potential to modify the soil through leaching of water-soluble compounds from leaves and litter decomposition. In southern France, six different thyme chemotypes can be distinguished based on the dominant monoterpene in the essential oil, which is either phenolic or non-phenolic in structure. We examine how soils from within and away from thyme patches in sites dominated by either phenolic or non-phenolic chemotypes affect germination, growth and reproduction of the associated grass species Bromus erectus. To do so, we collected seeds of B. erectus from three phenolic and three non-phenolic sites. Seeds and seedlings were grown on soils from these sites in a reciprocal transplant type experiment in the glasshouse. Brome of non-phenolic origin performed significantly better on its home soil than on soil from a different non-phenolic or a phenolic site. This response to local chemotypes was only observed on soil collected directly underneath thyme plants and not on soil in the same site (&lt;5 m away) but where no thyme plants were present. This is preliminary evidence that brome plants show an adaptive response to soil modifications mediated by the local thyme chemotypes. Reproductive effort was consistently higher in brome of phenolic origin than in brome of non-phenolic origin (on both thyme- and grass-soil), indicating that life-history variation may be related to environmental factors which also contribute to the spatial differentiation of thyme chemotypes. Moreover, we found that brome growing on thyme-soil in general was heavier than when growing on grass-soil, regardless of the origin of the brome plants. This is concordant with thyme-soil containing higher amounts of organic matter and nitrogen than grass-soil. Our results indicate that patterns of genetic differentiation and local adaptation may modify competitive interactions and possible facilitation effects in natural communities.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>EL-GAZZAR, A.</author><author>WATSON, L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SOME ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE TAXONOMY OF LABIATAE ESSENTIAL OILS AND RUSTS</title><secondary-title>New Phytologist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New Phytologist</full-title></periodical><pages>487-492</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://muse.lib.auth.gr:9797/com/blackwell-synergy/?MuseHost=www.blackwell-synergy.com&amp;MuseFirst=1&amp;prevSearch=allfield:(thymus+AND+(labiatae+OR+lamiaceae))&amp;StartMuseCookie=I2KBRCK=1;+path=/;+SERVER=10.0.20.25:8080;+path=/;+JSESSIONID=gbdwEZ34tGZWt4uGDaLvr;+path=/;+MAIDFILTER=ok;+path=/&amp;MusePath=/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1970.tb02444.x</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.</label><abstract>Essential oils extracted from twenty-two genera of Labiatae have been examined by gas-liquid chromatography.

This is particularly pertinent to species where variation in compound presence is under genetic control. In this study we have quantified variation in the inhibitory effects of the six dominant monoterpene oils produced by different genotypes (or chemotypes) of Thymus vulgaris on achene germination of an associated species (Brachy-podium phoenicoides), and seeds of T. vulgaris itself, in controlled experimental conditions. The experiments involved the germination of seeds of the two species with crushed leaves or pure essences of the six chemotypes, i.e. four experimental trials. A significant inhibitory effect against B. phoenicoides was found for both crushed leaves and the range of concentrations of purr oils used in the trial. The two phenolic compounds had a greater effect than the non-phenolic leaves and pure oils. The significant differences between non-phenols and the controls declined faster over time for crushed leaves and low concentrations of the pure essences than did that between the phenolics and the controls. There was a significant inhibitory effect against the germination of T. vulgaris seeds for the crushed leaves and the pure oils, although the contrast between the non-phenols and the phenols was not significant. The effect of the different oils varied depending on the seed source of the thyme seeds used in the trial. This is suggested to be due to differences in the rates of outcrossing among the sampled populations. The effects of the oils on the associated species, B. phoenicoides, were not found to be greater than their effects on the germination of thyme seeds. The results are discussed in the context of a potential role for such inhibitory effects in relation to the onset of rainfall and suitable germination conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>European Commision</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>INTERPRETATION MANUAL OF EUROPEAN UNION HABITATS</title></titles><periodical/><issue>July</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://European Commision - INTERPRETATION MANUAL OF EUROPEAN UNION HABITATS.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus praecox;Thymus serpyllum;Thymus teucrioides</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>European Environment Agency</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>EEA Reference grid</title></titles><periodical/><volume>http://www</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>Copenhagen</pub-location><publisher>EEA</publisher><urls/><label>Thyme;Thymus L.</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Evseenko, O V</author><author>Pavlenko, L A</author><author>Mishenkova, E L</author><author>Petrenko, G T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibition of the growth of phytopathogenic bacteria by preparations of higher plants</title><secondary-title>Mikrobiologichnyi Zhurnal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mikrobiologichnyi Zhurnal</full-title></periodical><pages>91-95</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1983</year></dates><isbn>0201-8462</isbn><urls><web-urls><url>http://muse.lib.auth.gr:9797/com/csa/?MuseHost=www-mi2.csa.com&amp;MuseFirst=1&amp;id=2&amp;recnum=2&amp;SID=147874bda29087943ea1dc03733c75de&amp;MusePath=/ids70/view_record.php</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus serpyllum</label><abstract>150 plant species of the Ukraine including medicinal and fodder ones belonging to 43 families were studied for their antibiotic action.

The oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and distillation-extraction and analysed by GC and GC-MS. The oil isolated from the flowers was obtained in a yield of 0.9%, whereas those isolated from the leaves during flowering and vegetative phases showed lower yields, 0.7% and 0.2% (v/w), respectively. The oils isolated from both the flowers and the leaves were dominated by the oxygen-containing monoterpenes (57-64%). The monoterpene hydrocarbons (11-22%) and the oxygen-containing sesquiterpenes (7-14%) were the two other main fractions of these oils. 1,8-Cineole (10-19%), linalyl acetate (6-14%) and linalol (4-12%) were the main components of all the oils studied. Intermedeol (2-4%), beta -caryophyllene oxide (2-3%) and viridiflorol (1-3%) were the main components of the oxygen-containing sesquiterpene fraction. The diterpene abietatriene was present in trace amounts (&lt;0.05%) in all the oils. Depending on the plant part studied and on the isolation procedure used, these oils can be characterized either by 1,8-cineole/linalol/linalyl acetate or 1,8-cineole type.

GC/MS analysis of the various fractions obtained at different extraction times and fractionation conditions allowed the identification of the best operating conditions to isolate the volatile extract. A good extraction performance was obtained operating at 90 bar and 50 degreesC for 300 min. The optimum fractionation was achieved by operating at 90 bar and -10 degreesC in the first separator and at 15 bar and 15 degreesC in the second one. The influence of extraction pressure and of extraction time on the extract composition were also evaluated. A comparison between a hydrodistilled oil of Thymus herba-barona and the supercritical extract is also given.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gouyon, P H</author><author>Vernet, P</author><author>Guillerm, J L</author><author>Valdeyron, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Polymorphisms and environment: the adaptive value of the oil polymorphisms in Thymus vulgaris L</title><secondary-title>Heredity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Heredity</full-title></periodical><pages>59-66</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1986</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Web Page">16</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Govaerts, R</author><author>Paton, A</author><author>Harvey, Y</author><author>Navarro, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>World checklist of Lamiaceae</title></titles><periodical/><volume>2011</volume><issue>08/10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>Kew</pub-location><publisher>The Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens</publisher><urls/><label>Flora;Thymus L.</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Groten, K</author><author>Bruelheide, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differences in soil conditions between heathlands and grasslands on Zechstein gypsum soils</title><secondary-title>Flora</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Flora</full-title></periodical><pages>347-359</pages><volume>192</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>CCA</keyword><keyword>Edaphic conditions</keyword><keyword>Grassland</keyword><keyword>Gypsum soil</keyword><keyword>Heathland</keyword><keyword>Transect</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Systematisch-Geobotanisches Inst., Universitat Gottingen, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany</pub-location><notes>Cited By (since 1996): 1</notes><research-notes>Cited By (since 1996): 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-0030693802&amp;partnerID=40&amp;rel=R6.5.0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus praecox</label><abstract>The distribution of heathland and grassland communities in respect to edaphic factors (exchangeable cations, organic C, total content of N, P) was investigated at two areas of the Zechstein belt in the southern part of the Harz mountains, Germany. Six transects, each with 12 quadrats of 0.5 x 0.5 m, were positioned in the transition zone of the two communities. Calluna vulgaris, Cladonia foliacea, C. rangiformis and Dicranum scoparium mainly occur in the heathlands, Galium verum, Euphorbia cyparissias, Thymus praecox, Brachypodium pinnatum and Koeleria macrantha in the grasslands. The results of CCA indicate a high correlation between the vegetation pattern and a gradient of pH value and soil depth. The humus layers of the Gypsum Rendzinas dominated by Calluna vulgaris show a diminished nutrient availability of N and P and they contain higher levels of Al and Fe in connection with lower pH values. In contrast, the soils under the grassland communities show higher pH values and thicker humus layers.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gumbinger, H G</author><author>Kemper, F H</author><author>Sourgens, H</author><author>Winterhoff, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antihormonal effects of plant extracts.

A total number of 172 taxa, Pteridophyta and Spermatophyta, were found in 18 selected market spots. Information is provided on the origin, the plant parts used, the ways of drug preparation and the medicinal uses of the herbs found. The majority of them (133 taxa) are of Greek origin and are gathered from the wild (99). A remarkable number of herbs (93) found in the market of Thessaloniki are mentioned by Dioscurides whereas the comparison to the recent ethnobotanical information shows that the utilization of Dioscurides' plants remains uninterrupted. Thus it is suggested that the herb trade is still based on the Greek ethnobotanical tradition, dating from antiquity. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

These compounds inhibited superoxide anion production in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system. Mitochondrial and microsomal lipid peroxidation induced by Fe(III)-ADP/NADH or Fe(III)-ADP/NADPH were also inhibited by these compounds. Compound 1 is an extremely potent antioxidant; complete inhibition was observed at 1 mu M against both microsomal and mitochondrial peroxidation. Furthermore, compound 1 protected red cells against oxidative hemolysis. These phenolic compounds were shown to be effective to protect biological systems against various oxidative stresses.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hartvig, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A taxonomical revision of Thymus sect.

Variations in oil composition and yield between cultivated and wild-growing plants collected from different localities, at different altitudes, have been also evaluated. Higher oil yields were observed in plants growing wild (3.7-5.6% of dried material) than in cultivated plants (1.1-2.0%), and those collected from the Mshaqar region, in the middle of Jordan and at the highest altitude, were the richest in oil (similar to 5.4%). Generally, the oil was characterized by marked levels of phenolic monoterpenoids (mainly thymol and carvacrol) in the range 70.8-89.0%. High levels of the monoterpenoid hydrocarbons p-cymene (3.4-8.2%) and gamma-terpinene (1.6-7.7%) were also observed. Other major components were 1,8-cineole (up to 2.1%), alpha-thujone (up to 1.2%), camphor (up to 1.1%) and fl-caryophyllene (0.2-2.8%). With the exception of plants growing wild in the Ramtha region, in the far north of Jordan, carvacrol was found as the principal phenol of all other oils (50.6-86.1%) and was dominant (&gt;85%) in wild plant oils. The oil from Ramtha was characterized by the highest level of thymol (similar to 63.8%) as the dominant phenol and was most abundant in p-eymene (8.2%), 1,8-cineole (2.1%) and gamma-terpinene (7.7%). In addition to assigning carvacrol or thymol chemotypes to the plant, the high content of active monoterpenoid phenols strongly suggests a potential use of Jordanian thyme oil in cough products and antimicrobial-herbal drug combinations.

The adopted methodology has been used to monitor seasonal variations in the composition of the oil obtained from thyme herbs harvested at different periods during the plant vegetative and life cycles. Oils from thyme plants of young (2 years) and old (5 years) cultivations have been evaluated from four and two collections, respectively, effected throughout May/December growth period. Generally, the oil was found to be rich in the active monoterpene phenols (thymol and carvacrol) and their corresponding monoterpene hydrocarbon (HC) precursors (p-cymene and gamma-terpinene), which collectively showed synchronized patterns of variation during the different collection periods and in different seasons. The oil from old plant collected in May/June period (0.15% v/w) was characterized by significantly lower levels of monoterpene HCs (mainly gamma-terpinene) and the highest levels of the oxygenated monoterpenes (linalool and borneol), monoterpene phenols (mainly thymol) and their derivatives (mainly carvacrol methyl ether), sesquiterpenes (mainly beta-caryophyllene) and their oxygenated derivatives (e.g. caryophyllene oxide) in comparison with all other samples. A characteristic presence of camphor and thymodihydroquinone was also observed in the old plant oils. On the other hand, the young plant, collected in June/July just before the end of the vegetative cycle, provided the best oil yield (1.2%) with also the highest % content of the monoterpene phenols (thymol: 51.2% and carvacrol: 4%). This latter growth period can represent the best harvest time of young thyme plants in order to obtain an essential oil with better quality and quantity.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hummelbrunner, L A</author><author>Isman, M B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acute, sublethal, antifeedant, and synergistic effects of monoterpenoid essential oil compounds on the tobacco cutworm, Spodoptera litura (Lep., Noctuidae)</title><secondary-title>Journal of agricultural and food chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of agricultural and food chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>715-720</pages><volume>49; 49</volume><issue>2; 2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><isbn>0021-8561</isbn><urls><web-urls><url>http://muse.lib.auth.gr:9797/com/csa/?MuseHost=www-mi2.csa.com&amp;MuseFirst=1&amp;id=2&amp;recnum=6&amp;SID=b8599c660c0d7abb640bacacd8dd54da&amp;MusePath=/ids70/view_record.php</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>Monoterpenoids (terpenes and biogenically related phenols) commonly found in plant essential oils were tested for acute toxicity via topical application to tobacco cutworms (Spodoptera litura Fab.). The most toxic among 10 such compounds was thymol (LD(50) = 25.4 microg/larva) from garden thyme, Thymus vulgaris. The compounds were then tested for sublethal effects, specifically inhibition of larval growth after topical application of low doses. Among 6 compounds tested, an LD(10) dose reduced growth by 20% on average 3 days after administration. Feeding deterrence was determined using a cabbage leaf disk choice test. The most deterrent compound was thymol, with a DC(50) of 85.6 microg/cm(2) leaf disk area. Because minor constituents in complex essential oils have been suggested to act as synergists, binary mixtures of the compounds were tested for synergy vis à vis acute toxicity and feeding deterrence. trans-Anethole acted synergistically with thymol, citronellal, and alpha-terpineol, in terms of both acute toxicity and feeding deterrence. On the basis of these findings, several complex mixtures were developed and tested as leads for effective control agents. Candidate mixtures demonstrated good synergistic effects. The observed LD(50) of mixture 3 was 40.6 microg/larvae compared to an expected value of 74.6 microg/larvae.

Here we evaluate how maternal and paternal origin, maternal and offspring sexual phenotype and degree of outcrossing jointly influence performance of gynodioecious Thymus vulgaris. 2 In uniform conditions we quantified size and survival of second-generation (G(2)) offspring produced by selfing and outcrossing on the open-pollinated offspring (G(1)) of G(0) females from four populations that differ in sex ratio, selfing rate and chemical type. We controlled for environmental variation, maternal effects and plant age. 3 Offspring with maternal parents from populations dominated by plants that synthesize phenolic monoterpenes had greater survival and size than those from populations with non-phenolic chemotypes. In addition, outcrossing among populations with pollen donors from non-phenolic populations significantly reduced progeny performance. These results suggest chemotype-mediated local adaptation. 4 The progeny of hermaphrodites showed significant inbreeding depression, which despite the pollination treatment x family and pollination treatment x population interactions, showed no consistent variation in relation to population inbreeding levels. 5 For a given level of outcrossing, the progeny of hermaphrodites showed greater among-family and among-population variation in plant size than those of females. Variation in nuclear restorer gene composition across cytoplasmic backgrounds may cause this variation. 6 T. vulgaris, diverse genetic factors jointly affect performance, a result with general implications for understanding fitness variation in natural populations.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>JustinAmiot</author><author>YannSalmon</author><author>ChristianCollinandJohnD.Thompson</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential resistance to freezing and spatial distribution in a chemically polymorphic plant Thymus vulgaris</title><secondary-title>Ecology Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecology Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>370-377</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><urls><web-urls><url>http://muse.lib.auth.gr:9797/com/blackwell-synergy/?MuseHost=www.blackwell-synergy.com&amp;MuseFirst=1&amp;prevSearch=allfield:(thymus+AND+(labiatae+OR+lamiaceae))&amp;StartMuseCookie=I2KBRCK=1;+path=/;+SERVER=10.0.20.25:8080;+path=/;+JSESSIONID=gbdwEZ34tGZWt4uGDaLvr;+path=/;+MAIDFILTER=ok;+path=/&amp;MusePath=/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00728.x</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>Secondary compounds play multiple ecological roles.

Each extract was submitted to an acid treatment (1.2 N HCl in 50% methanol) to determine whether such a process had an effect upon their chemistry and antioxidative efficacy. The treatment appeared to have improved the antioxidant potency of the extracts in general; however, there were some exceptions. The treatment did not increase the Fe(III) reductive activity of the extracts from basil or bay samples nor the ability of the oregano and sage extracts to scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals at pH 7.4. The Folin-Ciocalteu phenol content of the basil extract was not increased with acid treatment. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The overall results are discussed in relation to the taxonomic implications within the sect. Serpyllum. The first part is focused on the nomenclatural and morphological relationships of the nowadays known taxa of the genus Thymus L. to the: (a) polynomials mentioned in the early botanical works of the 16th to 18th century and (b) plant drawings and descriptions included in antiquity herbals, with emphasis on those based on the work of Dioscorides “Materia Medica”. Results suggest that genus Thymus is related with the pre-Linnaean group of polynomials Thymum and Serpyllum as well as the descriptions of the plants “thymos” and “erpyllos” as included in “Materia Medica” recensions. The overall study of characters suggests a shift in the type of characters used during pre- and post-Linnaean periods. In particular, vegetative macro-morphological characters are gradually enriched with or replaced by reproductive micro-morphological characters in recognizing new taxa. On the basis of this change new Thymus taxa from E Mediterranean were described, including Th. sibthorpii. In the second part, the analysis of Natura 2000 database and Th. sibthorpii herbarium specimens support three different habitat types as the most common for Th. sibthorpii populations, which occur in five floristic regions of Greece (i.e. NE, NC, EC, SPi and NAe). In the third part a total of 34 morphological characters of Thymus sibthorpii plant individuals are measured on plants collected from wild growing populations of six different habitat types. The variation of 28 characters is related to the habitat type where the plants were collected. The findings indicate that different habits of plants are related to the habitat types. Plants of Th. sibthorpii from different areas and habitat types were compared against herbarium vouchers of closely related taxa. Results suggest high morphological resemblance between the different Th. sibthorpii habits and specimens belonging to the species Th. heterotrichus Griseb., Th. comptus Friv. and Th. degenii Heinr.Braun. Consequently, four species, Th. sibthorpii s.str., Th. heterotrichus, Th. comptus and Th. degenii are herein proposed to be included under the group Th. sibthorpii s.lat. Finally, measurements (by hydrodistillation) of the essential oil content of leaves and inflorescences of single Th. sibthorpii plant individuals revealed a range between 0,2% and 3,5% (mL 100 g-1 dry weight). Furthermore, the essential oil content of individual plants is found to be related to the habitat type. Mean diameter and density of peltate glandular hairs can be used as an index of the essential oil content of leaves and inflorescences of Th. sibthorpii plant individuals.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Koureas, D N</author><author>Kokkini, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Habitat types of NATURA. 2000, sites as a tool for European biodiversity assessment: The case of Thymus plants</title><secondary-title>7th International PhD student symposium.

Total phenolic, flavonoid, catechin and anthocyanin content was determined by spectrophotometric methods. Oregano aqueous tea infusion had the highest amount of total phenols (12 500 mg/L gallic acid equivalent, GAE) and flavonoids (9000 mg/L GAE). Identification of polyphenolic compounds in aqueous tea infusions by HPLC-PDA analysis showed a dominant presence of rosmarinic acid (in mg/g): 123.11 in oregano, 17.45 in thyme and 93.13 in wild thyme. Antioxidant activity of aqueous tea infusions was evaluated using four antioxidative methods (the β-carotene bleaching method (BCB), the 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method, the thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TEARS assay) and the induction period of lard oxidation (Rancimat assay)). The results were compared with natural (ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol) and synthetic antioxidants, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). Oregano aqueous tea infusion showed the strongest antioxidant activity using three methods (the β-carotene bleaching method, DPPH radical scavening method and Rancimat assay), while thyme and wild thyme showed weaker and relatively similar antioxidant activity.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kultur, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Medicinal plants used in Kirklareli Province (Turkey)</title><secondary-title>Journal of ethnopharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of ethnopharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>341-364</pages><volume>111</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><notes>PT: J</notes><research-notes>PT: J</research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus longicaulis</label><abstract>In this paper, 126 traditional medicinal plants from Kirklareli Province in Turkey have been reported.

In the USA alone, there are an estimated 6-33 million cases each year. The list of responsible agents continues to grow. In the past 20 years some dozen new pathogens that are primarily food-borne have been identified. Fruits and vegetables, often from the global food market, have been added to the traditional vehicles of food-borne illness; that is, undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, or unpasteurized milk. Such products are minimally processed and have fewer barriers to microbial growth such as salt, sugar or preservatives. The evolution of the epidemiology of food-borne illness requires a rethinking of traditional, though still valid, solutions for their prevention. Among various strategies to prevent food-borne pathogens, use of dietary phytochemicals is promising. The major obstacle in the use of dietary phytochemical is the consistency of phytochemicals in different foods due to their natural genetic variation. We have developed a novel tissue-culture-based selection strategy to isolate elite phenolic phytochemical-producing clonal lines of species belonging to the family Lamiaceae. Among several species we have targeted elite clonal lines of thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and oregano (Origanum vulgare) against Escherichia coli and Closiridiiim perfrigens in fresh and processed meats. We are also evaluating high phenolic profile-containing clonal lines of basil (Ocimitm basilicum) to inhibit gastric ulcer-causing Helicobacter pylori. Other elite lines of the members of the family Lamiaceae, rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and salvia (Salvia officinalis) also hold promise against a wide range of food pathogens such as Salmonella species in poultry products and Vibrio species in seafood.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lacaita, C C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Two Critical Plants of the Greek Flora</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Botany</full-title></periodical><pages>125-129</pages><volume>203</volume><issue>269</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1917</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Lacaita - Two Critical Plants of the Greek Flora.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus heterotrichus;Thymus sibthorpii</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Landolt, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contributions to the flora of the city of Zurich.

The leaf area increased linearly from 959 cm(2) to 1635 cm(2) for Selection 1 and from 543 cm(2) to 1322 cm(2) for Selection 2 under natural light and from 1180 cm(2) to 3512 cm(2) for Selection 1 and from 958 to 2821 cm(2) for Selection 2 under supplemental light, respectively, for plants grown under 50 to 90% SWL. The coefficient of correlation between shoot yield and leaf area was highly significant (r(2) = 0.96). However, maximum essential oil content and yield per plant were recorded at 70% SWL for Selection 1 grown under SL. There were significant shifts in the content of phenols, particularly in monoterpene hydrocarbons in the essential oil, due to the differences in LR and SWL. The major constituent of the essential oil, thymol, accounted for the shift from about 48.6% to 85.5% for Selection 1 and the shift from 47.2% to 68.9% for Selection 2, depending on the treatment levels. Our data showed a maximum level of 85.5% thymol accumulation in the essential oil of Selection 1 grown at 70% SWL under SL.

Four different thyme monoterpene phenotypes ( chemotypes) were grown in a factorial of chemo- 4 x 2 x 2 type, caging ( sham half-cages vs. full cages), and competition ( control vs. the grass Bromus madritensis L.). Cages reduced numbers of arthropod predators. Thyme-feeding aphids Aphis serpylli Koch passed through full cage walls to increase more than fourfold. As a result, freed from their predators, aphids had a large negative effect on thyme size and flowering. Similarly, competition from Bromus had a negative effect on thyme size and flowering. Individual effects of aphids and competition were nonadditive, however, and their combined effect was significantly less than that predicted by a multiplicative null model. Differential thyme sizes among chemotypes were not mediated by herbivores or competitors, but differential flowering was due to the effects of chemotype on aphids. We thus document differential selection by aphids among thyme chemotypes and the influence of Bromus on the strength of these negative effects of aphids.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Linhart, Y B</author><author>Thompson, J D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thyme is of the essence: Biochemical polymorphism and multi-species deterrence</title><secondary-title>Evolutionary Ecology Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Evolutionary Ecology Research</full-title></periodical><pages>151-171</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1999</year></dates><notes>PT: J</notes><research-notes>PT: J</research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>Populations of the common thyme (Thymus vulgaris, Labiatae) are characterized by a complex genetic and biochemical polymorphism. Individual plants manufacture a single dominant monoterpene which gives them a characteristic smell and taste, and the genetic determination of these chemotypes involves a series of five loci interacting with each other in epistatic fashion. We tested the hypothesis that multi-species herbivory and allelopathy are associated with this monoterpene polymorphism. We compared the relative attractiveness and deterrence of various chemotypes by offering either thyme plants or artificial diets laced with monoterpenes to six herbivores: two molluscs, two insects and two mammals. In addition, we summarize experiments by us and others in which bacteria, fungi and seeds of the grass Brachypodium phoenicoides, a common competitor of T. vulgaris, were exposed to the individual monoterpenes. The results show that the monoterpenes have differential deterrence value against these various species. We conclude that a combination of selective herbivory and allelopathy contributes to the maintenance of this polymorphism.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Linhart, Y B</author><author>Thompson, J D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Terpene-based selective herbivory by Helix aspersa (Mollusca) on Thymus vulgaris (Labiatae)</title><secondary-title>Oecologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oecologia</full-title></periodical><pages>126-132</pages><volume>102</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1995</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Univ.CO,Dept Environ.Popul.&amp; Orgmic Biol., Boulder, CO 80309, United States</pub-location><notes>        From Duplicate 1 (                           Terpene-Based Selective Herbivory by Helix-Aspersa (Mollusca) on Thymus-Vulgaris (Labiatae)                         - Linhart, Y B; Thompson, J D )

Individual populations may contain all six chemotypes, but are often dominated by one to three chemotypes. We tested the hypothesis that this chemical polymorphism was associated with selective herbivory by the snail Helix aspersa, which feeds upon T. vulgaris in nature. The relative preference of juvenile and adult molluscs was investigated by presenting individual animals with a choice of six chemotypes in three experimental trials: (1) whole plants, (2) nutritive gels containing crushed thyme leaves, and (3) nutritive gels containing a distilled monoterpene as an additive. We found significant and consistent patterns of preference. Adult and immature molluscs preferred the linalol chemotype, and ate carvacrol and thymol-containing foods the least. This preference was more marked when using the gels than the real plants, particularly the monoterpene-based gels, demonstrating the importance of the monoterpene for the choice. Furthermore, molluscs fed exclusively on linalol-containing food gained weight whereas those fed on carvacrol-containing food lost weight. After being fed these exclusive diets both groups showed a significant preference for linalol. These results (1) demonstrate that food choice is based upon the presence of specific monoterpenes and is not learned, (2) suggest that phenolic monoterpenes such as carvacrol are repellent to the animals, and (3) indicate that selective herbivory may play a significant role in the maintenance of the chemical polymorphism of T. vulgaris.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lopez-Pujol, J</author><author>Bosch, Maria</author><author>Simon, Joan</author><author>Blanche, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Allozyme Diversity in the Tetraploid Endemic Thymus loscosii (Lamiaceae)</title><secondary-title>Annals of Botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Botany</full-title></periodical><pages>323-332</pages><volume>93</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Allozyme electrophoresis</keyword><keyword>Conservation</keyword><keyword>Endemic species</keyword><keyword>Genetic diversity</keyword><keyword>Lamiaceae</keyword><keyword>Tetraploidy</keyword><keyword>Thymusloscosii</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><pub-location>GReB, Laboratori de Botànica, Facultat de Farmàcia, Universitat de Barcelona, Avda.

It is a tetraploid species (2n = 54), presumably an autotetraploid originated by the duplication of a 2n = 28 genome and the subsequent loss of two chromosomes. Allozyme electrophoresis was conducted to survey the levels and distribution of genetic diversity and to test the previous autopolyploid hypothesis for its origin. In addition, both in situ and ex situ conservation measures are proposed. Methods Eight populations were sampled for analysis by standard methods of starch gel electrophoresis, and six putative enzymatic loci were resolved (five consistently and one only partially). Key Results Banding patterns exhibited no evidence of fixed heterozygosity and showed both balanced and unbalanced heterozygotes. In addition, most individuals showed a pattern consistent with the presence of three or four alleles at a single locus. High levels of genetic variability were found at population level (P = 85 %, A = 3(.)0, H-e = 0.422), in addition to a trend of an excess of heterozygotes. Conclusions Allozyme data support the hypothesis that T. loscosii is an autotetraploid, and the high number of alleles at some loci may be due to repeated polyploidization events. The high values of genetic variation found in this species agree with those expected for tetraploids. The excess of heterozygotes may be due to some barriers to inbreeding (e.g. occurrence of gynodioecy) and/or selection for heterozygosity.

The study revealed remarkable infraspecific variation in the oil composition. Five main groups of the plants were observed using hierarchical cluster analysis based on the major essential oil constituents. Consequently, five chemotypes of T. serpyllum have been defined, namely 1,8-cineole, germacrene B, (E)-β-ocimene, (α-cadinol and ds-p-menth-2-en-1-ol. It was concluded that there is no clear relation in the oil composition between the studied varieties and chemotypes. Two chemotypes were defined within the ssp. serpyllum var. serpyllum, two chemotypes within the ssp. serpyllum var. lineatus, and one chemotype within ssp. serpyllum var. rigidus. © 2006 Allured Publishing Corp.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Loziene, K</author><author>Venskutonis, P.R.

Whereas spatial structure of cytoplasmic factors which cause male-sterility has been studied in several taxa, that of nuclear factors that restore male-fertility (restoration factors) has received little attention. In this paper, we estimate spatial variation in the frequency of restoration factors associated with different cytoplasmic male-sterilities in the gynodioecious Thymus vulgaris. Clonal replicates of five female plants bearing at least four different male-sterilities and originating from five different populations (i.e., five cytogenotypes), were reciprocally transplanted into the original populations. Following open pollination at each site, seeds were harvested, germinated and grown to flowering. The frequency of hermaphrodites in each progeny was used to estimate the frequency of restoration factors in each population. For all cytogenotypes, there was marked variation in the rate of restoration among populations, indicating that spatial structure in nuclear restoration factors may influence the variation in female frequency in T. vulgaris. For three out of the five cytogenotypes, higher restoration rates were obtained for females introduced into their original population, which agrees with the theoretical prediction, under some hypotheses, that restoration factors are selected for in populations that contain the associated male-sterility (Gouyon and Couvet, 1985). The very low restoration rate in the progeny of one female clone in three populations indicates that stochastic events, such as founder effects, could lead to a local absence of restoration factors and thus the high female frequency (up to 90%) observed in some populations. Differences among cytogenotypes suggest that some male-sterilities are associated with rarer restoration factors and are thus more likely to cause patches of females to develop in young populations.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manicacci, Domenica</author><author>Atlan, Anne</author><author>Rossello, Juana Anna Elena</author><author>Couvet, Denis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gynodioecy and reproductive trait variation in three Thymus species (Lamiaceae)</title><secondary-title>International journal of plant sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of plant sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>948-957</pages><volume>159</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1998</year></dates><publisher>JSTOR</publisher><notes>        From Duplicate 1 (                           Gynodioecy and reproductive trait variation in three Thymus species (Lamiaceae)                         - Manicacci, Domenica; Atlan, Anne; Rossello, Juana Anna Elena; Couvet, Denis )

      </research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>We studied the general features of the reproductive system of two sympatric species Thymus zygis and Thymus mastichina (Lamiaceae) near Salamanca, Spain, and compare our data with previous and original data on the gynodioecious Thymus vulgaris studied near Montpellier, France. The frequency of females is high on average and strongly variable among natural populations and species: 51% (17-87) in T. zygis, 72% (41-99) in T. mastichina, and 63% (34-88) in T, vulgaris. The high female frequencies in some populations and the strong maternal inheritance of the sexual phenotype indicate a nuclear-cytoplasmic determination of sex in both Spanish species, as already demonstrated in T. vulgaris. At the species level, we found a tendency for a positive association of the average frequency of females with both the relative fecundity of females and the relative allocation into male function in hermaphrodites. Among natural populations within each of the three species in contrast, these traits were not significantly related to each other. We propose that temporal variation of female frequency in natural populations prevents natural selection from adjusting female frequency and reproductive parameters.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manou, I</author><author>Bouillard, L</author><author>Devleeschouwer, M J</author><author>Barel, A O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of the preservative properties of Thymus vulgaris essential oil in topically applied formulations under a challenge test</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>368-376</pages><volume>84</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1998</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Lab.

The thyme essential oils were tested for their inhibitory effects against nine strains of gram-negative bacteria and six strains of gram-positive bacteria. The bioimpedance method was chosen for studying the antibacterial activity of the essential oils and the parameter chosen for defining and quantifying the antibacterial activity of the essential oils was the detection time. The plate counting technique was used to study the inhibitory effect by direct contact. All the thyme essential oils examined had a significant bacteriostatic activity against the microorganisms tested. This activity was more marked against the gram-positive bacteria. The oil from thyme in full flower was the most effective at stopping the growth of the microbial species examined. The oils tested were also shown to have good antibacterial activity by direct contact, which appeared to be more marked against the gram-negative bacteria. Only a few of the species were capable of recovering at least 50% of their metabolic function after contact with the inhibitor, while most of the strains were shown to have been inactivated almost completely. Escherichia coli O157:H7 was the most sensitive species, given that after contact with even the lowest concentration of oil cells could not be recovered.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martí, D</author><author>Pérez-Gracia, M T</author><author>Blanquer, A</author><author>Villagrasa, V</author><author>Sanahuja, M A</author><author>MorenoRoyo, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thymus piperella (L.) essential oil: An alternative in the treatment of diarrhoea</title><secondary-title>Flavour and Fragrance Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Flavour and Fragrance Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>201-205</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Anti-microbial</keyword><keyword>Anti-spasmodic</keyword><keyword>Essential oil</keyword><keyword>In vitro activity</keyword><keyword>Smooth muscle</keyword><keyword>Thymus piperella (L.)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Department of Physiology, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Cardenal Herrera University, Av.

(family Labiatae) is an endemic taxon found in eastern Spain. The aerial part of T. piperella is principally used for culinary purposes, to flavour stuffings, sauces, pickles, stews, soups, etc. Moreover, it has traditionally been used to conserve and soften olives, and in the distillation of an alcoholic beverage named 'herbero', which is typical in the south of Valencia and north of Alicante, and whose digestive properties are well documented. Despite it being a popular plant in this region, to date T. piperella (L.) has not been pharmacologically described. Pharmacological assays have been carried out on the essential oil of Thymus piperella (L.) leaves. The oil was shown to be innocuous according to the acute oral toxicity test and exhibited antispasmodic action that significantly inhibited the contractions induced by acetylcholine in the isolated rat ileum in a concentration-dependent manner. Essential oil from Thymus piperella (L.) leaves was active against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes and Mycobacterium phlei. Such antimicrobial activity would explain the popular use of this plant in the conservation of olives. Moreover, as the inhibition of contractile overactivity of the ileum (antispasmodic action) is the basis of the treatment of some gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhoea, and as many diarrhoea-causing diseases are associated with intestinal infection, Thymus piperella essential oil could constitute an alternative therapy in such cases. In this way, this species, so commonly used in the Mediterranean kitchen, may be beneficial to the health in more ways than one.

Essential oil yield (l/ha), from replicated, pilot-scale distillations, was influenced by both the held production of herb and the essential oil content of the herb. The oil yield peaked at 22.8 l/ha in December, after flowering had finished. Essential oil composition also varied significantly during the 13-month sampling period. Levels of the phenolic components, thymol and carvacrol, peaked at a total of 37% after flowering in summer (December and January). p-Cymene was an important component of Central Otago thyme oils and ranged from 40% to 50% in winter and early spring (May to October), declining to 21% in January. To maximize yields and phenol content of the oil, naturalized thyme in Central Otago should be harvested after flowering has finished in December.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meister, A</author><author>Bernhardt, G</author><author>Christoffel, V</author><author>Buschauer, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antispasmodic activity of Thymus vulgaris extract on the isolated guinea-pig trachea: Discrimination between drug and ethanol effects</title><secondary-title>Planta Medica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Planta Medica</full-title></periodical><pages>512-516</pages><volume>65</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1999</year></dates><notes>PT: J</notes><research-notes>PT: J</research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>The effect of an extract of Thymus vulgaris on induced spasms was investigated on guinea-pig trachea preparations.

Antioxidant activity of these compounds along with 4 flavonoids isolated from thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) was evaluated by the oil stability index method using a model substrate oil including methyl linoleate in silicone oil at 90 degreesC. Carnosol, rosmanol, epirosmanol, isorosmanol, galdosol, and carnosic acid exhibited remarkably strong activity, which was comparable to that of alpha-tocopherol. The activity of miltirone, atuntzensin A, luteolin, 7-O-methyl luteolin, and eupafolin was comparable to that of butylated hydroxytoluene. The activity of these compounds was mainly due to the presence of ortho-dihydroxy groups. The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity of these compounds showed the similar result.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mockute, D</author><author>Bernotiene, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>1,8-cineole - Caryophyllene oxide chemotype of essential oil of Thymus serpyllum L. growing wild in Vilnius (Lithuania)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Essential Oil Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Essential Oil Research</full-title></periodical><pages>236-238</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><notes>PT: J</notes><research-notes>PT: J</research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus serpyllum</label><abstract>The chemical composition of the essential oils of Thymus serpyllum L.ssp. serpyllum var.serpyllum growing wild in Vilnius (East Lithuania) has been studied.

Thyme volatile phenolic oil has been reported to be among the top 10 essential oils, showing antibacterial, antimycotic, antioxidative, natural food preservative, and mammalian age delaying properties. It has been known that agronomical factors have a great effect on both quality and quantity of essential metabolites. For this reason, it is necessary to determine optimum levels of agronomical factors affecting plant growth and production. Planting space and time of harvesting are the most important agronomical factors. This study has been conducted in Research farm of ACECR, Institute of Medicinal Plants &amp; Natural Products Research along 1999-2000 on the base of factorial experiment in randomized complete block design with three replications. Thyme is cultivated in rows of 50cm apart with inter-row spacing of 15, 30 or 45cm. Plants are harvested in three stages, i.e. the beginning of blooming, full blooming and fruit set. In order to study the effects of plants space and time of harvesting, plant height, plant diameter, yields of dry and fresh herbage, content (%) and yield of oil, thymol and carvacrol were measured. Planting space had significant effect on plant diameter (P&lt;0.05) and very significant effect (P&lt;0.01) on other measured parameters except oil content, which was not significant. Time of harvest had significant effect on yield of fresh herbage, content of oil and content of carvacrol (P&lt;0.05). Its effect on other parameters was very significant (P&lt;0.01) except dry herbage and oil yield. The maximum yield of dry and fresh herbage, yield and content of oil and thymol yield were obtained in 15cm space and beginning of blooming stage. Maximum thymol content was observed in the beginning of blooming and 45cm space. However, 15cm spacing and harvesting in the beginning of blooming was the best treatment in respect of yield of dry matter, oil and thymol per unit area. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

From the Labiatae family, Rosmarinus officinalis, Thymus vulgaris, Origanum vulgare and O. majorana gave 26 active compounds. Over 40 antioxidative compounds from Zingiber officinale, 26 compounds from Curcuma domestica = C. longa, C. xanthorrhiza and Z. cassumunar were determined, these belonging to the family Zingiberaceae. From the family Myrtaceae, 25 compounds from the berries of Pimenta dioica, were determined and 3 carbazoles were isolated from Murraya koenigii.

Extracts from lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), peppermint (Mentha x piperita), prunella (Prunella vulgaris), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), sage (Salvia officinalis) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris) were screened. Their inhibitory activity against Herpes simplex virus type I (IHISV-1), type 2 (HSV-2) and an acyclovir-resistant strain of HSV-1 (ACV(res)) was tested in vitro on RC-37 cells in a plaque reduction assay. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the extracts for HSV plaque formation were determined in dose-response studies. All test compounds showed a high antiviral activity against HSV-1, HSV-2 and ACV(res). in order to identify the mode of antiviral action, the extracts were added to the cells or viruses at different stages of infection. Both types of Herpes virus including ACVres were considerably neutralized after treatment with the extracts prior to infection. At maximum non-cytotoxic concentrations of the extracts, plaque formation was significantly reduced by &gt; 90% for HSV-1 and HSV-2 and &gt; 85% for ACV(res). In time-response studies over a period of 2 hours, a clearly time-dependent activity was demonstrated. These results indicate that the extracts affect HSV before adsorption, but have no effect on the intracellular virus replication. Therefore, the extracts exert their antiviral effect on free HSV and offer a chance to use them for topical therapeutic application against recurrent Herpes infections.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Okazaki, K</author><author>Kawazoe, K</author><author>Takaishi, Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human platelet aggregation inhibitors from thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.)</title><secondary-title>Phytotherapy Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Phytotherapy Research</full-title></periodical><pages>398-399</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><notes>PT: J</notes><research-notes>PT: J</research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>Two antiaggregant compounds, thymol (compound 1) and 3,4,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-5,5'-diisopropyl-2,2'-dimethylbiphenyl (compound 2) were isolated from the leaves of thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.).

The method was adapted from a spot test originally devised for in vitro detection of phenolic compounds in organic analyses. Plant subjects were the Lamiaceae species Thymus vulgaris L., Oreganum vulgare L. and Mentha x piperha L., which accumulate essential oil in glandular trichomes. A reagent consisting of 4-nitrosophenol in cone. H2SO4 was applied to sample leaves of each species. A positive test for phenol was indicated by the production of coloured indophenols. Using this method, monoterpene phenols were identified in the trichomes of T. vulgaris (thymol) and O. vulgare (carvacrol), indicated by colour changes to red and green respectively. No phenol was detected in trichomes of M. x piperita. Results were confirmed by GC-MS analysis of leaf volatile extracts from each species, and In vitro tests with thymol and carvacrol. The method could be used in field surveys for rapid identification of potential medicinal plants and bioactive compounds.

The undisturbed site harbored 40 herbaceous species making up 87% of the absolute cover. AM colonization was recorded in 25 species accounting for 77% of the relative cover. Species with 51-75% AM root colonization such as Festuca ovina and Leontodon hispidus dominated the undisturbed turf, contributing 45% to the relative cover. Carex ssp. were the most abundant nonmycorrhizal plants and accounted for 9% of the relative cover. Spores of Glomus aggregatum, G. constrictum, G. fasciculatum, G. pansihalos, Glomus sp. and Entrophospora sp. averaged 25 per 100 g dry substrate at the undisturbed site. The disturbed site was colonized by 25 species accounting for 17% of the absolute cover. Among the AM plants, most abundant were the species with up to 20% AM root colonization, such as Agrostis stolonifera and Thymus pulegioides, wich accounted for 24% of the relative cover. Nonmycorrhizal species, such as Biscutella laevigata, Cardaminopsis arenosa, Gypsophila fastigiata and Silene vulgaris, dominated the early succession community and contributed 64% to the relative cover. Spores of G. fasciculatum and Entrophospora sp. averaged 20 per 100 g dry substrate at the disturbed site. © Springer-Verlag 1996.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedanius, Dioscorides</author><author>Anazarbos, of</author><author>Turkey, De materia medica.

Correlations of final germination percentage of each population with seed weight and various geographic parameters (longitude, latitude, and altitude) were studied. For each species, final germination percentages were highly variable depending on the population, ranging from 16 to 95% for Lavandula stoechas, 4-95% for Thymus zygis, 13-90% for T. vulgaris, 35-95% for T. mastichina, and 21-91% for Origanum vulgare. Similarly, germination rate (T50) varied significantly. A significant relationship between seed weight and final germination percentage was identified for the populations of L. stoechas and O. vulgare. Moreover, germination percentages correlated significantly with altitude in T. mastichina, and with longitude in O. vulgare. In addition, seed weight showed a significant relationship with longitude in O. vulgare and with latitude in T. mastichina.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Petanidou, T</author><author>Smets, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Does temperature stress induce nectar secretion in Mediterranean plants ?</title><secondary-title>New Phytologist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New Phytologist</full-title></periodical><pages>513-518</pages><volume>133</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Ballota acetabulosa</keyword><keyword>Mediterranean plants</keyword><keyword>Nectar secretion</keyword><keyword>Temperature effect</keyword><keyword>Thymus capitatus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Botanical Institute, Laboratory of Systematics, Catholic University of Leuven, Kardinaal Mercierlaan 92, B-3001 Heverlee (Leuven), Belgium</pub-location><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-0030470032&amp;partnerID=40&amp;rel=R6.5.0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus capitatus</label><abstract>We studied the effect of temperature on nectar secretion in Thymus capitatus, a typical labiate of phrygana (i.e. the garrigue of the East Mediterranean Basin). Experiments were carried out at controlled temperatures in a climatic chamber. We measured the nectar standing crop of the flowers at the end of the first day of their anthesis. All nectar values (i.e. volume per flower, sugar content and concentration) increased with temperature up to 38 °C, as long as the plants were not water stressed. However, in the open and under normal temperate conditions (i.e. at relatively low temperatures) nectar secretion depended more on changes in solar irradiance than on temperature. Under the same conditions, nectar secretion in Ballota acetabulosa, a species that is sympatric and coflowering with T. capitatus, was affected neither by light nor temperature. Since in the wild these two species are found in different microhabitats (full sun and shade, for T. capitatus and B. acetabulosa, respectively), we attribute the differences we observed to the differential natural adaptation of the plants to these factors. We conclude that T. capitatus is very well adapted to the Mediterranean conditions. By performing optimally as a nectar source at high temperatures, it can support a very large insect fauna that visits its flowers for nectar. It is in fact a temperature-induced cornucopian species.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pigott, Author C D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>No Title</title></titles><periodical/><pages>365-387</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Pigott - No Title.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus pulegioides;Thymus serpyllum</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pina-Vaz, C.</author><author>Gonçalves Rodrigues, A.</author><author>Pinto, E.</author><author>Costa-de-Oliveira, S.</author><author>Tavares, C.</author><author>Salgueiro, L.</author><author>Cavaleiro, C.</author><author>Gonçalves, M.</author><author>Martinez-de-Oliveira, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antifungal activity of Thymus oils and their major compounds</title><secondary-title>Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology</full-title></periodical><pages>73-78</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Essential oils</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://muse.lib.auth.gr:9797/com/blackwell-synergy/?MuseHost=www.blackwell-synergy.com&amp;MuseFirst=1&amp;prevSearch=allfield:(thymus+AND+(labiatae+OR+lamiaceae))&amp;StartMuseCookie=I2KBRCK=1;+path=/;+SERVER=10.0.20.25:8080;+path=/;+JSESSIONID=gbdwEZ34tGZWt4uGDaLvr;+path=/;+MAIDFILTER=ok;+path=/&amp;MusePath=/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-3083.2004.00886.x</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.</label><abstract>The increasing recognition and importance of fungal infections, the difficulties encountered in their treatment and the increase in resistance to antifungals have stimulated the search for therapeutic alternatives.

The monoterpene hydrocarbon p-cymene (64.2%) dominated T. leucospermus oil, followed by γ-terpinene (7.9%), thymol (4.8%), and borneol (4.7%), whereas the most abundant constituents in T. teucrioides subsp. candilicus oil were p-cymene (25.5%), γ-terpinene (19.0%), thymol (18.8%), borneol (5.7%), and α-pinene (5.7%). The larvicidal and repellent activities of the analyzed essential oils were tested on Culex pipiens larvae and adults, respectively. Additionally, the main metabolite of the essential oils, p-cymene was tested against C. pipiens adults in order to define the affiliation between p-cymene and the repellent properties of the oil. The essential oils of T. leucospermus and T. teucrioides subsp. candilicus provided repellency 78.1% and 72.9%, respectively, statistically equal to the reference product icaridin. The compound p-cymene showed almost no repellent activity. The essential oil of T. leucospermus presented lower larvicidal activity (LC50 = 34.26 mgl-1) against C. pipiens third-fourth instar larvae while T. teucrioides subsp. candilicus was the most active with an estimated LC50 value of 23.17 mgl-1. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Platearius, Matthaeus</author><author>D.1161</author><author>Italy, Circa instans.

The essential oil content of the Hungarian thyme samples varied between very low (0.14 mL/100 g DW) and fairly high (1.9 mL/100 g DW) values. Significant essential oil polymorphism was found: altogether twelve chemovarieties may have been determined, representing a way of adaptation to different habitat conditions. The main volatile compound of chemotype 1 was thymol (24.6-67.5%), while in the case of chemotype 2, thymol (36.5-63.7%) and p-cymene (11.5-27.3%) predominated. Thymol (28.4-63.7%), p-cymene (11.5-31.8%) and γ-terpinene (9.7-20.9%) were identified as the chief monoterpenes of chemotype 3, while chemotype 4 contained thymol (36.5%), p-cymene (27.3%) and neral (11.2%). Chemotype 5 accumulated thymol (38.5%), p-cymene (20.6%), γ-terpinene (12.0%) and β-bisabolene (10.3%) as its main volatiles. The oil of chemotype 6 can be characterized by thymol (41.9%), p-cymene (20.2%), isoborneol (10.3%) and ã-terpinene (9.9%), while that of chemotype 7 consisted of thymol (27.7%), linalyl acetate (18.8%), γ-terpinene (18.6%) and α-cubebene (13.9%). In the oil of chemotype 8, p-cymene (45.0%), geraniol (13.6%) and linalyl acetate (9.9%) were found in higher percentages, while chemotype 9 mainly produced linalyl acetate (36.2%) and geranyl acetate (20.2%). Chemotype 10 accumulated germacrene-D (43.4) and β-caryophyllene (15.0%), while the oil of chemotype 11 contained caryophyllene oxide (45.2%), α-cubebene (15.7%) and linalool (13.8%) in high proportions. Germacrene-D (29.7%), β-caryophyllene (22.0%) and farnesol (10.4%) were identified as main essential oil compounds of chemotype 12. The last nine chemotypes were new for the literature, while the first seven contained thymol as their chief compound. The role of certain sesquiterpenes was found to be considerable.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Poulose, A J</author><author>Croteau, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biosynthesis of aromatic monoterpenes: conversion of γ-terpinene to p-cymene and thymol in Thymus vulgaris L.</title><secondary-title>Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>307-314</pages><volume>187</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1978</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pseudo-Dioscorides</author><author>Italy, De herbis femininis.

Tolnaftate B.P. 1% w/w was used as an antifungal reference drug. In addition to possessing antifungal properties, the oil inhibited all three stages of asexual reproduction, i.e. spore germination, mycelial growth and spore formation. The intensity of inhibitory effect varied with the species and the concentration of the oil used. A. niger was found to be the most sensitive at its germination stage, whereas A. foetidus was most sensitive at the mycelial growth and spore formation stage. At the same concentration, the effects of the oil and antifungal drug were the same at the mycelial growth stage, as in the case of A. oryzae. Overall, the inhibition of mycelial growth was better via T. serpyllum oil than the antifungal drug. Spore lysis was observed in the case of A. niger when spores were exposed to the oil.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ramanoelina, A R</author><author>Terrom, G P</author><author>Bianchini, J P</author><author>Coulanges, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antibacterial action of essential oils extracted from Madagascar plants</title><secondary-title>Archives de l&quot;Institut Pasteur de Madagascar</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Archives de l&quot;Institut Pasteur de Madagascar</full-title></periodical><pages>217-226</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1987</year></dates><notes>Cited By (since 1996): 13</notes><research-notes>Cited By (since 1996): 13</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-0023465636&amp;partnerID=40&amp;rel=R6.5.0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>The following aromatherapy study reports the antimicrobial activity of eight Malagasy essential oils by the determination of their respective M.I.C. (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration) on enteropathogenic and spoilage bacteria strains. The aromatic plants used were taken from the Labiatae family (Thymus vulgaris, Ocimum gratissimum), the Myrtaceae family (Eugenia caryophyllata, Melaleuca viridiflora) and the Compositae (Helichrysum lavanduloides, H. bracteiferum, H. gymnocephalum, Psiadia altissima). Their inhibitory effect were tested on eight referied strains commonly used for antibiotic measurements and also on twelve others enteropathogenic bacteria strains. The results showed that three oils from Thymus vulgaris, Ocimum gratissimum and Eugenia caryophyllata were particularly efficient with a large spectra action. We noticed that the essential oil of Melaleuca viridiflora had also a high inhibitory effect especially on Gram positive bacteria.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rance, Southern F</author><author>Arayre, L E T</author><author>Aprade, P Ierre S Aumitou</author><author>Oe, J</author><author>Uguen, L C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>( CP DNA ) AND NUCLEAR ( ALLOZYME ) MARKERS WITHIN AND AMONG POPULATIONS OF THE GYNODIOECIOUS T HYMUS VULGARIS ( L ABIATAE )</title></titles><periodical/><pages>1675-1684</pages><volume>84</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>allozymes</keyword><keyword>central concern of plant</keyword><keyword>cpdna</keyword><keyword>documenting spatial patterns of</keyword><keyword>evolutionary biology</keyword><keyword>gene flow</keyword><keyword>genetic variation is a</keyword><keyword>gynodioecy</keyword><keyword>labiatae</keyword><keyword>population structure</keyword><keyword>quantifi-</keyword><keyword>thymus vulgaris</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Rance et al. - ( CP DNA ) AND NUCLEAR ( ALLOZYME ) MARKERS WITHIN AND AMONG POPULATIONS OF THE GYNODIOECIOUS T HYMUS VULGARIS ( L ABIATAE ).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reddy, M V B</author><author>Angers, P</author><author>Gosselin, A</author><author>Arul, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization and use of essential oil from Thymus vulgaris against Botrytis cinerea and Rhizopus stolonifer in strawberry fruits</title><secondary-title>Phytochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Phytochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>1515-1520</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Antifungal</keyword><keyword>Botrytis cinerea</keyword><keyword>Fragaria ananassa</keyword><keyword>Labiatae</keyword><keyword>Rhizopus stolonifer</keyword><keyword>Rosaceae</keyword><keyword>Strawberries</keyword><keyword>Thyme</keyword><keyword>Thymus vulgaris</keyword><keyword>Volatile components</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Dept. of Food Science and Nutrition, Horticultural Research Center, Laval University, Sainte-Foy, Que.

Contents were high in p-cymene, linalool, terpinen-4-ol and thymol which constituted 53.5% and 66.2% of Laval-1 and Laval-2 essential oils respectively. The essential oil volatiles from two clonal types exhibited antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea and Rhizopus stolonifer, two common storage pathogens of strawberries (Fragaria ananassa). The inhibition of B. cinerea and R. stolonifer ranged from 26.5 to 63.5% and 5.5 to 50.5% respectively by oil from Laval-1, when exposed to concentrations of 50 to 200 ppm, while values of 36.9 to 90.5% and 11.5 to 65.8% were observed from oil from Laval-2. The decay of strawberry fruits caused by B. cinerea and R. stolonifer was controlled up to 73.6 and 73.0% respectively by volatiles from maximin concentration of Laval-l, and up to 75.8 and 74.8% from Laval-2. No visual phytotoxic symptoms were noticed for the observed period. Essential oil from Laval-2 exhibited higher antifungal activity which was related to its relatively higher content of antimicrobial compounds.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Regnaultroger, C</author><author>Hamraoui, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibition of Reproduction of Acanthoscelides-Obtectus Say (Coleoptera), a Kidney Bean (Phaseolus-Vulgaris) Bruchid, by Aromatic Essential Oils</title><secondary-title>Crop Protection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Crop Protection</full-title></periodical><pages>624-628</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1994</year></dates><notes>PT: J</notes><research-notes>PT: J</research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>Acanthoscelides obtectus Say (Coleoptera, Bruchidae), is a cosmopolitan pest that damages its host plant, the kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in the field and during storage.

However, aromatic plants from the families Lamiaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae and Poaceae can protect kidney beans by direct or delayed insecticidal effect, through increased adult mortality and inhibition of beetle reproduction (both oviposition and adult emergence). The efficiency of hydrodistillated and intact plants from Thymus vulgaris and T. serpyllum, Mentha piperata, Rosmarinus officinalis, Satureia hortensis, Eucalyptus globulus, Laurus nobilis, Origanum vulgare, and Cymbopogon nardus was compared. For both extracts, Origanum vulgare had the best effect. The insecticidal effect was induced by more than the essential oils because no significant difference was noticed between distilled and intact plants extract. Inhibition of reproduction was particularly important. These results suggest that lipidic as well as non lipidic, allelochemicals, such as phenolics, or non-protein amino-acids, or flavonoids may be involved in the toxicity of aromatic plants to this beetle. © 1995 Birkhäuser Verlag.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Regnault-Roger, C</author><author>Hamraoui, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficiency of Plants from the South of France used as Traditional Protectants of Phaseolus-Vulgaris L Against its Bruchid Acanthoscelides-Obtectus (Say)</title><secondary-title>Journal of stored products research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of stored products research</full-title></periodical><pages>259-264</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1993</year></dates><isbn>0022-474X</isbn><notes>        From Duplicate 1 (                           Efficiency of Plants from the South of France used as Traditional Protectants of Phaseolus-Vulgaris L Against its Bruchid Acanthoscelides-Obtectus (Say)                         - Regnaultroger, C; Hamraoui, A )

The efficiency of these practices are tested and the effects of plants and botanicals on physiological behaviour of A. obtectus have been evaluated (ovipositional activity, growth inhibition and adult mortality). A statistical study shows significant differences in the tested plants (Allium sativum, Laurus nobilis, Tilia cordata sylvestris, Origanum serpyllum, Eucalyptus globulus, Cymbopogan nardus, Thymus vulgaris, Thymus serpyllum, Rosmarinus officinalis, Satureia hortensis).

Cultivars differed in susceptibility to the pathogen: ''Spicy globe'' miniature was the most susceptible, and lemon basil (Ocimum basilicum var. citriodorum), Origanum majorana, and Thymus vulgaris were rated as not susceptible. Twenty isolates of F. oxysporum, originating from stems of diseased basil plants in Israel, were pathogenic on basil in growth chamber and greenhouse tests. Under artificial inoculation, 2 isolates of F. oxysporum f. sp. basilicum from stems were pathogenic to basil but not to 9 species representing Lamiaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, and Compositae, indicating the specificity of the pathogen to basil. These isolates were used for additional resistance tests. Ocimum basilicum var. purpurascens (Exotic) and var. citriodorum were rated as not susceptible to the pathogen under artificial inoculation. Resistant germ plasm was identified in several basil plants of a local variety originally introduced from the United States and reselected at Newe Ya'ar. Seeds were planted in the greenhouse in naturally highly infested soil. Symptomless plants that survived in naturally infested soil were the source for F1 seeds of resistant germ plasm, which was confirmed by artificial inoculations with both isolates of the pathogen. Further selection tests to improve resistance were conducted up to the F4 generation in infested soil in the greenhouse. All individuals of the present genetic line remained symptomless, while all individual plants of the original susceptible cultivar defoliated 3 weeks after planting into infested soil, suggesting that the resistance may be a single, dominant gene. The causal organism was reisolated only from the susceptible plants and not from the symptomless resistant plants through all the experiments.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ronniger, Karl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Beitrage zur Kenntnis der Thymus-Flora der Balkanhalbinsel.

These compounds were evaluated for fumigant activity against adults of Sitophilus oryzae, Rhyzopertha dominica and Tribolium castaneum. The insecticidal activities varied with insect species, compound and the exposure time. The most sensitive species was S. oryzae, followed by Rhyzopertha dominica. Tribolium castaneum was highly tolerant of the tested compounds. 1,8-Cineole, borneol and thymol were highly effective against S. oryzae when applied for 24 h at the lowest dose (0.1 μl/720 ml volume). For Rhyzopertha dominica camphor and linalool were highly effective and produced 100% mortality in the same conditions. Against Tribolium castaneum no oil compounds achieved more than 20% mortality after exposure for 24 h, even with the highest dose (100 μl/720 ml volume). However, after 7 days exposure 1,8-cineole produced 92.5% mortality, followed by camphor (77.5%) and linalool (70.0%). These compounds may be suitable as fumigants because of their high volatility, effectiveness, and their safety. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These properties were compared to those of Thymus vulgaris essential oil, used as a reference ingredient. Antioxidant and radical-scavenging properties were tested by means of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryihydrazyl (DPPH) assay, beta-carotene bleaching test and luminol-photochemiluminescence (PCL) assay. In the DPPH assay, C. odorata, C citratus, R. officinalis and C longa showed major effectiveness, with a radical inhibition ranging from 59.6 +/- 0.42-64.3 +/- 0.45%. In the P-carotene bleaching test, C odorata (75.5 +/- 0.53%), R. officinalis (81.1 +/- 0.57%) and C longa (72.4 +/- 0.51%) gave the best inhibition results. Similar results were obtained for the same essential oils in the PCL assay. Antimicrobial properties were obtained on five food-spoilage yeasts: Candida albicans ATCC 48274, Rhodotorula glutinis ATCC 16740, Schizosaccharomyces pombe ATCC 60232, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 2365, Yarrowia lypolitica ATCC 16617. C citratus and T x citriodorus were the most effective against the tested strains. Suggestions on relationships between chemical composition and biological activities are outlined.

The thymol chemotype is widespread and is found in most of the vegetal formations where Thymus hyemalis is predominant and does not interact with other species. The carvacrol chemotype is found in isolated individual plants among those containing thymol. Although the chemotypes are usually mutually exclusive, the two phenols occasionally found with similar quantities in the same plant. The linalool chemotype has not previously been described for Thymus hyemalis. Other nonphenolic compounds (1,8-cineole, borneol, cc-pinene) are present in low to medium percentages that reflect localized interactions with other species of thyme (Thymus vulgaris, Thymus baeticus) that sometimes produce hybridized or introgressive, morphologically distinguishable individuals. This chemical variability is analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA), a closely-related phenolic group of samples being revealed separated from less well represented non-phenolic chemotypes or mixed chemotypes. Multidimensional Scaling Analysis (MDS) based on percentage concentration was used to show the relationships between the most important components of the essential oil, the opposite orientation of vectors that represent phenolic compounds (and their precursors) and linalool, being of note. The data set presents positive correlation between camphor and altitude.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saez, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Volatile oil variability in Thymus serpylloides ssp. gadorensis growing wild in Southeastern spain</title><secondary-title>Biochemical Systematics and Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemical Systematics and Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>189-198</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Caryophyllene oxide</keyword><keyword>Essential oil</keyword><keyword>Geraniol</keyword><keyword>Lamiaceae</keyword><keyword>Linalool</keyword><keyword>Myrcene</keyword><keyword>Thymol</keyword><keyword>Thymus serpylloides ssp. gadorensis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Geology Department, Fac. of Math. and Natural Sciences, Bergen University, Allégaten 41, 5007-Bergen, Norway</pub-location><notes>        From Duplicate 1 (                           Volatile oil variability in Thymus serpylloides ssp. gadorensis growing wild in Southeastern spain                         - Saez, F )

Many of the samples showed a phenolic chemotype, while another important group had significant levels of linalool. Geraniol, myrcene, caryophyllene oxide, terpinen-4-o1 and 1,8-cineole were commonly present. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA) of this chemical variability separated two groups of plants characterized by either phenols or linalool, and an isolated third type with geraniol. A few samples were found to have both phenolic and non-phenolic compounds in high quantities, thus showing a mixed chemotype. Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) of the percentage concentration for each component of the essential oil showed that thymol, linalool, 1,8-cineole, borneol and geraniol have clear divergent vectors. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sáez, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Essential oil variability of Thymus baeticus growing wild in southeastern Spain</title><secondary-title>Biochemical Systematics and Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemical Systematics and Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>269-276</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>1</keyword><keyword>8-cineole</keyword><keyword>Borneol</keyword><keyword>Chemotaxonomy</keyword><keyword>Essential oil</keyword><keyword>Lamiaceae</keyword><keyword>Terpinen-4-ol</keyword><keyword>Thymus baeticus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Depto. de Biologia Veg.(Botanica), Facultad de Biología, Universidad de Murcia, 30.100-Espinardo (Murcia), Spain</pub-location><notes>        From Duplicate 1 (                           Essential oil variability of Thymus baeticus growing wild in southeastern Spain                         - Sáez, F )

Thymol and carvacrol were recorded only in small quantities. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis revealed great variability, with the samples being quite isolated and distancing from each other, although a major group of individuals characterized by terpinen-4-ol was detected. Multidimensional scaling analysis of the percentage concentration for each identified component of the essential oil showed terpinen-4-ol, 1,8-cineole and borneol to be the most divergent components.

Two principles were used in determining the antibacterial effects of spice hydrosols: inhibition zones were determined by paper disc diffusion method, and the bacteriostatic effects, bactericidal effects and the growth inhibition levels were studied as colony forming units (cfu) in broth cultures. All tested bacteria were inhibited by all of the spice hydrosols using paper disc diffusion method. According to serial dilution method, while all spice hydrosols at 10 and 25 mL/100 mL concentrations had generally bacteriostatic activities, the same hydrosols appeared to have bactericidal effects at concentrations above 50 mL/100 mL. The most sensitive of the bacteria against the spice hydrosols was S. aureus. In addition, the most inhibitive of the spice hydrosols on the four pathogenic bacteria were O. onites L. and O. majorana L. (C) 2003 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology.

(Lamiaceae), an endemic plant species of Turkey known as wild thyme, is traditionally used as a spice and a wild tea in the Inner Anatolia region of Turkey. In this study the composition of the essential oil and the antimicrobial and antioxidant effects of the methanolic extract and essential oil of T. argaeus were determined.RESULTS: The main components of the essential oil were linalool (499 g kg-1), [alpha]-terpineol (150 g kg-1), linalyl acetate (97 g kg-1) and thymol (94 g kg-1). The total phenolic, flavanol and flavonol contents of the extract were 83.31 ± 0.59 mg gallic acid equivalent g-1, 6.26 ± 0.00 mg catechin equivalent g-1 and 28.81 ± 0.21 mg rutin equivalent g-1 respectively. The antioxidant activities of the extract and essential oil determined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging method were 830.18 ± 0.42 and 20.47 ± 2.3 mg g-1 respectively. The antimicrobial activities of the extract and essential oil against 13 bacteria and two yeasts were studied by the agar diffusion method. The micro-organisms most sensitive to the essential oil were Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the micro-organism most sensitive to the extract was P. aeruginosa.CONCLUSION: Only the extract of T. argaeus could be used as a natural antioxidant, while both the extract and the essential oil could be useful as natural antimicrobial agents in food preservation.

Lopez and R. Morales and one population of T. x mourae Paiva and Salgueiro, two endemic taxa from Portugal, was investigated mainly by GC and GC-MS. T x mourae is a natural hybrid between T. lotocephalus and T. mastichina (L.) L. subsp, donyanae R. Morales, which essential oil was analysed for the first time. In its oil, it was possible to find compounds of both parents, which could enable us to confirm its intermediate status between those two taxa. 1,8-Cineole and borneol were the main constituents in the essential oil of T. x mourae, whereas linalool, geranyl acetate and 1,8- cineol were the major ones in T. lotocephalus. Intermedeol was also an important constituent in the oils of both taxa. Nevertheless, the volatile oils of the four populations investigated of T. lotocephalus showed important differences among the main constituents. In order to study their infraspecific variability, the results obtained in the analysis of individual plants were submitted to a Principal Component and Chemometric Cluster Analyses. Five types of essential oils were found: linalool, 1,8-cineole, linalool/1,8-cineole, linalyl acetate/linalool and geranyl acetate.

Durand) Jalas (syn. T. drucei Ronn.) collected in Scotland, Ireland, and in the south of England have been analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in order to elucidate the chemical character of this subspecies on the British Isles. In total, 69 components were identified, most of them monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids with hedycaryol, linalyl acetate, linalool, the germacradienols, trans-nerolidol, T-cadinol, and β-caryophyllene being the most important compounds. The analysis of the quantitative essential oil data by means of neural networks revealed that T. praecox subsp. arcticus growing in Britain is highly polymorphous. There were 17 chemotypes with the hedycaryol chemotype as the most frequent (24% of the plants), followed by the linalool/linalyl acetate chemotype (22% of the plants) and germacra-1(10),4-dien-6-ol chemotype (18% of the plants). It seems that each part of the British Isles has its special chemotype pattern with 13 chemotypes in Scotland, 11 in Ireland, and 17 in the south of England. An overview of the North Atlantic region of Europe revealed that the polymorphism of T. praecox subsp. arcticus in the essential oil is more distinctive in the southern than in the northern regions, with only 2, 5, and 1 chemotypes in Greenland, Iceland, and Norway, respectively. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

(Labiatae) essential oils and their components against 17 micromycetal food poisoning, plant, animal and human pathogens are presented. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodestillation of dried plant material. Their composition was determined by GC-MS. Identification of individual constituents was made by comparison with analytical standards, and by computer matching mass spectral data with those of the Wiley/NBS Library of Mass Spectra. MIC's and MFC's of the oils and their components were determined by dilution assays. Thymol (48.9%) and p-cymene (19.0%) were the main components of T. vulgaris, while carvacrol (12.8%), a-terpinyl acetate (12.3%), cis-myrtanol (11.2%) and thymol (10.4%) were dominant in T. tosevii. Both Thymus species showed very strong antifungal activities. In M. piperita oil menthol (37.4%), menthyl acetate (17.4%) and menthone (12.7%) were the main components, whereas those of M. spicata oil were carvone (69.5%) and menthone (21.9%). Mentha sp. showed strong antifungal activities, however lower than Thymus sp. The commercial fungicide, bifonazole, used as a control, had much lower antifungal activity than the oils and components investigated. It is concluded that essential oils of Thymus and Mentha species possess great antifungal potential and could be used as natural preservatives and fungicides.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spiewak, R</author><author>Skorska, C</author><author>Dutkiewicz, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Occupational airborne contact dermatitis caused by thyme dust</title><secondary-title>Contact dermatitis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Contact dermatitis</full-title></periodical><pages>235-239</pages><volume>44; 44</volume><issue>4; 4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><isbn>0105-1873</isbn><urls><web-urls><url>http://muse.lib.auth.gr:9797/com/csa/?MuseHost=www-mi2.csa.com&amp;MuseFirst=1&amp;id=2&amp;recnum=5&amp;SID=b8599c660c0d7abb640bacacd8dd54da&amp;MusePath=/ids70/view_record.php</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>The aim of the study was to assess occupational hazards to the farmer's skin associated with processing thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.). 46 farmers were studied during the threshing of dried thyme. They were questioned about work-related skin problems and examined before and after work. In all persons, serum thyme-specific IgE was measured. Skin prick tests, the Ouchterlony test and the migration inhibition test were carried out with allergens of airborne bacteria and fungi present in the working environment. Of the 46 farmers studied, 4 showed skin symptoms after 5-30 min of exposure to thyme dust. Thyme-specific IgE was found in 1 person with work-related symptoms, but also in 2 asymptomatic farmers. Therefore, the importance of IgE seems to be questionable in eczema related to thyme dust. Skin and blood tests with microbial allergens also showed no significant differences between the symptomatic and asymptomatic farmers. To our knowledge, this is the 1st description of occupational airborne contact dermatitis caused by thyme dust. The etiology of thyme-related skin symptoms remains obscure, although an irritant mechanism seems probable</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stahl Biskup, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The chemical composition of Thymus oils: a review of the literature 1960-1989</title><secondary-title>Journal of Essential Oil Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Essential Oil Research</full-title></periodical><pages>61-82</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1991</year></dates><urls/><label>Thyme;Thymus L.</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Standard, International</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>INTERNATIONAL</title></titles><periodical/><volume>1996</volume><keywords/><dates><year>1996</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Standard - INTERNATIONAL.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stefanini, I</author><author>Piccaglia, R</author><author>Marotti, M</author><author>Biavati, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization and biological activity of essential oils from fourteen Labiatae species</title><secondary-title>Acta Horticulturae</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Horticulturae</full-title></periodical><pages>221-226</pages><volume>723</volume><keywords><keyword>Antimicrobial activity</keyword><keyword>Antioxidant activity</keyword><keyword>GC-MS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Department of Agroenvironmental Sciences and Technologies, Bologna University, Italy</pub-location><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-33846036924&amp;partnerID=40&amp;rel=R6.5.0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus capitatus</label><abstract>The Labiatae family is rich in plants that are sources of essential oils having aromatic notes and biological properties. Considering the interest in natural products for cosmetic, perfumery, food and pharmacological industry, the deeper knowledge of the potentiality of different aromatic plants can give results of economic importance. In our work, the essential oils of fourteen species were evaluated for their quali- quantitative composition and biological activity. The species analysed are: basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), beebalm (Monarda didyma L.), pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium L.), spearmint (Mentha spicata L.), headed savory (Thymus capitatus Hoffm.et Link), calamint (Calamintha nepeta L.), winter savory (Satureja montana L.), savory (Satureja cuneifolia Ten.), thymbra (Thymbra sintenisii Bornm. et Aznav. ssp. isaurica P.H. Davis), a cultivated rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L) and four wild rosemaries harvested in different Italian locations: Elba Island (Tuscany), Sicily, Abruzzo and Calabria. The oils, obtained by steam-distillation of fresh aerial part of the plants harvested at full flowering stage, were characterized by GC-MS, tested for antimicrobial property by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and for the antioxidant activity by B-carotene bleaching test. Each species was characterized by a peculiar qualiquantitative composition and all the oils contained compounds with established biological activity. Headed savory exerted the highest antimicrobial control also at low concentrations. Basil and rosemary from Elba Island evidenced a great antioxidant capability comparable to that of α-tocopherol used as reference antioxidant agent.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Zhen-Xiao X</author><author>Sun, Jin-Hua H</author><author>Cheng, Shuang</author><author>Ma, Qing-Wen W</author><author>Guo, Shan-Li L</author><author>Zhang, Jin-Bao B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Original studies on anti-tumor and immunological effect of extracts from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak in mice</title><secondary-title>Zhong xi yi jie he xue bao = Journal of Chinese integrative medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhong xi yi jie he xue bao = Journal of Chinese integrative medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>209-210</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2003</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Department of Biology, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, Shandong Province 252059, China.</pub-location><isbn>1672-1977</isbn><notes>        From Duplicate 1 (                           [Original studies on anti-tumor and immunological effect of extracts from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak in mice]                         - Sun, Zhen-Xiao X; Sun, Jin-Hua H; Cheng, Shuang; Ma, Qing-Wen W; Guo, Shan-Li L; Zhang, Jin-Bao B )

METHODS: Different doses of volatile oil and alcohol extracted substances from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak were given to mice bearing S180 tumor for 9 days. Tumor inhibition rates and coefficients of spleen and thymus were determined. RESULTS: Tumor inhibition rates of the groups with alcohol extracts (40 g crude drug.kg(-1).d(-1) and 20 g crude drug.kg(-1).d(-1)) were 51.5% (P&lt;0.01) and 36.4% (P&lt;0.05) respectively, and those of the groups with volatile oil (40 g crude drug.kg(-1).d(-1) and 20 g crude drug.kg(-1).d(-1))were both 39.4% (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: The extracts from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak have anti-tumor activities. The coefficient of spleen in group with alcohol extracts (40 g crude drug.kg(-1).d(-1))was close to normal value, and its coefficient of thymus was between that of the negative control group and the group with cyclophosphamide (0.02 g.kg(-1).d(-1)). The anti-tumor activity of the alcohol extracts was significantly higher than that of the control group and the tumor inhibition rate was depending on drug concentration. Depending on index of immunity,the extracts from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak may have some influences on immunity.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Superior, Consejo</author><author>Cient, Investigaciones</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monografías del real jardín botánico</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Superior, Cient - Monografías del real jardín botánico.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus serpyllum;Thymus vulgaris</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tarayre, M</author><author>Thompson, J D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Population genetic structure of the gynodioecious Thymus vulgaris L.

In the gynodioecious Thymus vulgaris L., female frequency varies from 5 to 95%, providing a suitable model to examine this issue. In this study, we use allozyme markers to (1) evaluate the relationship between female frequency, genetic diversity and population structure, (2) determine whether females and hermaphrodites vary in heterozygote deficiency and (3) examine whether other factors such as plant density are related to heterozygote deficiency. Twenty three natural populations, with female frequencies ranging from 11 to 92%, were sampled in and around the St-Martin-de-Londres basin in southern France. Based on four polymorphic allozyme loci, we found no significant correlation between female frequency and heterozygote deficiency. A significant (P &lt; 0.05) F sub(IS) value over loci and over populations of 0.11 was detected. The F sub(IS) value per population showed a significant heterozygote deficiency in 11 of the 23 populations. However, no significant difference between female and hermaphrodite F sub(IS) values was found. A significant heterozygote deficiency only occurred in populations of intermediate density. There was little differentiation among populations (F sub(ST)= 0.038) nor among subpopulations within each population. The significant F sub(IS) values are thus mostly due to inbreeding effects. The lack of a correlation between F sub(IS) values and female frequency may be due to outcrossing in hermaphrodites and/or restoration of male fertility which may occur to a greater extent at low female frequency. The similarity of female and hermaphrodite F sub(IS) values indicates that females may occasion high levels of biparental inbreeding</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>TARAYRE, M</author><author>THOMPSON, J D</author><author>MANICACCI, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thirty-Five Years of Thyme: A Tale of Two Polymorphisms</title><secondary-title>BioScience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioScience</full-title></periodical><pages>805-815</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1998</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://muse.lib.auth.gr:9797/com/csa/?MuseHost=www-mi2.csa.com&amp;MuseFirst=1&amp;id=2&amp;recnum=2&amp;SID=686e18bda0daa536a33eb2d7c501c5dc&amp;MusePath=/ids70/view_record.php</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>The aromatic or wild thyme (Thymus vulgaris) is a small, woody shrub of the Labiatae family that inhabits open areas in the western Mediterranean basin. Two types of polymorphic variation exhibited by thyme have provided for the study of the evolutionary dynamics of genetic polymorphisms. First, wild thyme plants bear either female or hermaphrodite flowers but not both, which makes them gynodioecious. In southern France, populations exhibit female frequencies ranging from 5% to more than 90%, which is much higher than other gynodioecious species. Second, six different genetically determined monoterpene compositions of thyme's oil can be found in southern France. The authors John D. Thompson, Domenica Manicacci, and Michele Tarayre have synthesized 35 years of past research on the gynodioecy and oil compound variation of thyme in reference to the high frequency of females and number of oil compounds. The average female frequency of the thyme populations is approximately 60%, which indicates cytoplasmic inheritance. Although nuclear genes are also involved in the determination of sexual phenotype, cytoplasmic sterility genes may block male function. Field investigations have determined that female frequency is correlated with population age, with young populations bearing a high number of females. The male function of nuclear genes is suspected of being restored from the sterility influence of cytoplasmic genes by appropriate alleles of restorer genes in the nuclear genome. The possibility that restorer alleles are lacking in patches of colonizing populations is suggested by the low levels of mitochondrial DNA and chloroplast DNA diversity in the populations. Studies have also shown that male-fertility restoration is more frequent when the females are pollinated by males of the original populations than for females cross-pollinated by distant populations. Other fitness considerations include a possible inbreeding depression among hermaphrodites, reduced seed production resulting from resource allocation toward pollen, and a variable sexual resource investment in hermaphrodites. Eleven species of the genus Thymus ranging from southeastern Spain to south-central France were studied by T. Adzet and others who found a pattern of geographic variation in their occurrence, with the three chemotypes of cineol, borneol, and camphene found in southeastern Spain; the phenolics of carvacrol and thymol abundant in northern Spain and southern France; and nonphenolics increasing in frequency toward the northern latitudes. The geographical distribution indicates an adaptive strategy whereby phenolic compounds are produced in response to hot, dry climates and nonphenolic compounds are produced in cool, moist habitats. The geographical distribution also occurs at a microhabitat scale according to microclimates and is thought to be in response to drought stress, interspecific competition, and herbivory</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>TARDÍO, J.</author><author>PARDO-DE-SANTAYANA, M.</author><author>MORALES, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ethnobotanical review of wild edible plants in Spain</title><secondary-title>Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society</full-title></periodical><pages>27-71</pages><volume>152</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://TARDÍO, PARDO-DE-SANTAYANA, MORALES - Ethnobotanical review of wild edible plants in Spain.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Thyme;Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Terrab, A.</author><author>Pontes, A.</author><author>Heredia, F.J.</author><author>Diez, M.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A preliminary palynological characterization of Spanish thyme honeys</title><secondary-title>Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society</full-title></periodical><pages>323-330</pages><volume>146</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://muse.lib.auth.gr:9797/com/blackwell-synergy/?MuseHost=www.blackwell-synergy.com&amp;MuseFirst=1&amp;prevSearch=allfield:(thymus+AND+(labiatae+OR+lamiaceae))&amp;StartMuseCookie=I2KBRCK=1;+path=/;+SERVER=10.0.20.25:8080;+path=/;+JSESSIONID=gbdwEZ34tGZWt4uGDaLvr;+path=/;+MAIDFILTER=ok;+path=/&amp;MusePath=/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2004.00335.x</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thyme;Thymus L.</label><abstract>Pollen was analysed in 25 thyme honey samples from Spain.

Although some populations have a single chemotype in majority, many have two or three chemotypes. In this study we analyze the quantitative variation among T. vulgaris populations in the percentage of oil composed of the dominant monoterpene(s) for each chemotype. In general, phenolic chemotypes (thymol and carvacrol), which occur at the end of the biosynthetic chain, have a significantly lower proportion of their oil composed of their dominant monoterpene than nonphenolic chemotypes (geraniol, α-terpineol, and linalool). This is due to the presence of high amounts of precursors (γ-terpinene and paracymene) in the oil of phenolic chemotypes. The essential oil of the nonphenolic thuyanol chemotype has four characteristic monoterpenes that together make up a lower proportion of the oil than the single dominant monoterpene of the other nonphenolic chemotypes. For all chemotypes, the percentage composition of the dominant monoterpene decreased significantly at sites where the chemotype is not the majority type. This decrease is correlated with a significant increase in either the proportion of the two precursors for the thymol chemotype or the monoterpenes characteristic of the other chemotypes at the site. The latter result suggests that a plant with dominant genes is responsible for the production of different monoterpenes can produce several molecules.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thompson, J D</author><author>Gauthier, P</author><author>Amiot, J</author><author>Ehlers, B K</author><author>Collin, C</author><author>Fossat, J</author><author>Barrios, V</author><author>Arnaud-Miramont, F</author><author>Keefover-Ring, K</author><author>Linhart, Y B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ongoing adaptation to mediterranean climate extremes in a chemically polymorphic plant</title><secondary-title>Ecological Monographs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Monographs</full-title></periodical><pages>421-439</pages><volume>77</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><notes>PT: J</notes><research-notes>PT: J</research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>Although extreme climatic events may have profound effects on ecological systems. there is a marked lack of information on adaptation to such events.

Survival and growth were analyzed in relation to long-term and contemporary climate data in natural Populations and our experimental sites. The reciprocal transplants involved a period of six years for clones transplanted in experimental field sites on a geographic scale and three years for seedlings transplanted among natural populations at the local landscape level. Cloned transplants on a geographic scale produced evidence for local adaptation to either summer drought, primarily following the extreme summer drought of 2003, or severe early-winter freezing. Chemotypes that show high survival after intense summer drought showed poor survival after intense early-winter freezing and vice versa, results which directly accord with climate data for their original sites. On the local landscape scale, we found further evidence for local adaptation to summer drought but not to winter freezing (probably due to the absence of extreme freezing during the three years of this study). Future modifications to the occurrence and frequency of extreme climate events may have a profound influence on the spatial distribution of thyme chemotypes.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thompson, J D</author><author>Tarayre, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploring the genetic basis and proximate causes of female fertility advantage in gynodioecious Thymus vulgaris</title><secondary-title>Evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Evolution</full-title></periodical><pages>1510-1520</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><notes>PT: J</notes><research-notes>PT: J</research-notes><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>In many gynodioecous species, females produce more viable seeds than hermaphrodites. Knowledge of the relative contribution of inbreeding depression in hermaphrodites and maternal sex effects to the female fertility advantage and the genetic basis of variation in female fertility advantage is central to our understanding of the evolution of gender specialization. In this study we examine the relative contribution of inbreeding and maternal sex to the female fertility advantage in gynodioecious Thymus vulgaris and quantify whether there is genetically based variation in female fertility advantage for plants from four populations. Following controlled self and outcross (sib, within population, and between-population) pollination, females had a more than twofold fertility advantage (based on the number of germinating seeds per fruit), regardless of the population of origin and the type of pollination. Inbreeding depression on viable seed production by hermaphrodites occurred in two populations, where inbreeding had been previously detected. Biparental inbreeding depression on viable seed production occurred in three of four populations for females, but in only one population for hermaphrodites. Whereas the maternal sex effect may consistently enhance female fertility advantage, inbreeding effects may be limited to particular population contexts where inbreeding may occur. A significant family X maternal sex interaction effect on viable seed production was observed, illustrating that the extent of female fertility advantage varies significantly among families. This result is due to greater variation in hermaphrodite (relative to female) seed fertility between families. Despite this genetic variation in female fertility advantage and the highly female biased sex ratios in populations of T. vulgaris, gynodioecy is a stable polymorphism, suggesting that strong genetic and/or ecological constraints influence the stability of this polymorphism.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thompson, J.

L.) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) plants were determined after 8 weeks under 350, 1,500, 3,000, 10,000 and 30,000 μmol mol-1 CO2. Plants were grown in vitro on basal medium (BM) consisting of Murashige and Skoog salts and 0.8% agar that contained either 0 or 3% sucrose under a 16-h (day)/8-h (night) photoperiod at a light intensity of 180 μmol s-1 m-2 or in soil in a greenhouse under conditions of natural sunlight. Ultra-high CO2 levels (i.e. ≥3,000 μmol mol-1 CO2) substantially increased fresh weights, leaves, shoots and roots for all plants compared to plants grown under ambient air (350 μmol mol-1 CO2) both in vivo and in vitro. For both species, 10,000 μmol mol-1 CO2 was the optimum concentration to obtain the largest growth and morphogenesis responses under in vitro conditions, while the 3,000- to 10,000-μmol mol-1 CO2 range provided the largest yields for soil-grown plants. Essential oil composition (i.e. monoterpenes, piperitonone oxide and limonene from mint and aromatic phenol and thymol from thyme) from the shoot portion of plants grown at all CO2 levels was analyzed in CH2Cl2 extracts via gas chromatography. Higher levels of secondary compounds occurred in vitro when cultures were grown under ultra-high CO2 levels than in ambient air. The concentration of thymol, a major secondary compound in thyme plants grown on BM containing sucrose, was 317-fold higher at 10,000 μmol mol-1 CO2 than in plants grown under ambient air conditions with the same BM. The levels of secondary compound in in-vitro-grown plantlets exposed to ultra-high CO2 concentrations exceeded those occurring in plants grown in the greenhouse under the same CO2 levels. Substantially higher levels of secondary compound occurred in plants under ultra-high CO2 levels on BM containing sucrose than on BM lacking sucrose or in soil. Thymol levels in thyme plants grown on BM containing sucrose were 3.9-fold higher at 10,000 μmol mol-1 CO2 than in shoots grown on BM without sucrose under the same CO2 levels. High positive correlations occurred between thymol concentrations and CO2 levels, fresh weights, shoots, roots and leaves when thyme shoots were grown on BM with sucrose. High positive correlations for thyme shoots grown on BM without sucrose only occurred between thymol concentrations and CO2 levels, fresh weights, shoots and leaves. No positive correlations between thymol concentrations and CO2 levels or any growth or morphogenesis responses occurred for thyme shoots when grown in soil.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tisserat, B</author><author>Vaughn, S F</author><author>Silman, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of modified oxygen and carbon dioxide atmospheres on mint and thyme plant growth, morphogenesis and secondary metabolism in vitro</title><secondary-title>Plant Cell Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plant Cell Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>912-916</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>CO2 enrichment</keyword><keyword>Lamiaceae</keyword><keyword>Mentha sp.</keyword><keyword>Thymol</keyword><keyword>Thymus sativa</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research, Fermentation Biotechnology Research Unit, 1815 N University St., Peoria, IL 61604, United States; Affiliation: U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Cen</pub-location><notes>        From Duplicate 1 (                           Influence of modified oxygen and carbon dioxide atmospheres on mint and thyme plant growth, morphogenesis and secondary metabolism in vitro                         - Tisserat, B; Vaughn, S F; Silman, R )

Plants were grown in vitro on Murashige and Skoog salts, 3% sucrose and 0.8% agar under a 16/8-h (day/night) photoperiod with a light intensity of 180 μmol s-1 m-2. Growth and morphogenesis responses varied considerably for the two plant species tested depending on the level of O2 administered. Growth was considerably enhanced for both species under all O2 levels tested when 10,000 μmol mol-1 CO2 was added as compared to growth responses obtained at the same O2 levels tested with 350 μmol mol-1 CO2. Mint shoots exhibited high growth and morphogenesis responses for all O2 levels tested with 10,000 μmol mol-1 CO2. In contrast, thyme shoots exhibited enhanced growth and morphogenesis when cultured in ≥21% O2 with 10,000 μmol mol-1 CO2 included compared to shoots cultured under lower O2 levels. Essential oil compositions (i.e. monoterpene, piperitenone oxide from mint and aromatic phenol, thymol from thyme) were analyzed from CH2Cl2 extracts via gas chromatography from the shoot portion of plants grown at all O2 levels. The highest levels of thymol were produced from thyme shoots cultured under 10% and 21% O2 with 10,000 μmol mol-1 CO2 and levels were considerably lower in shoots grown under either lower or higher O2 levels. Higher levels of piperitenone oxide were obtained from mint cultures grown under ≥21% O2 with 10,000 μmol mol-1 CO2 compared to that obtained with lower O2 levels.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tümen, G</author><author>Başer, K H C</author><author>Demirci, B</author><author>Ermin, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The essential oils of Satureja coerulea Janka and Thymus aznavourii Velen.</title><secondary-title>Flavour and Fragrance Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Flavour and Fragrance Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>65-67</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Essential oils</keyword><keyword>Germacrene-D</keyword><keyword>Lamiaceae</keyword><keyword>Satureja coerulea Janka</keyword><keyword>Thymus aznavourii Velen.</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Department of Biology, Faculty of Education, Balikesir University, 10100 Balikesir, Turkey; Affiliation: Med.

This study aims to investigate the in vitro pharmacological interactions between essential oils (considered valuable as natural therapeutic treatments) and conventional antimicrobials (ciprofloxacin/amphotericin B) when used in combination. Methods and Results: Interactions of the essential oils (Melaleuca alternifolia, Thymus vulgaris, Mentha piperita and Rosmarinus officinalis) when combined with ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus indicate mainly antagonistic profiles. When tested against Klebsiella pneumoniae the isobolograms show antagonistic, synergistic and additive interactions depending on the combined ratio. The R. officinalis/ciprofloxacin combination against K. pneumoniae displayed the most favourable synergistic pattern. The interactions of M. alternifolia (tea tree), T. vulgaris (thyme), M. piperita (peppermint) and R. officinalis (rosemary) essential oils with amphotericin B indicate mainly antagonistic profiles when tested against Candida albicans. Conclusion: While a number of interactions show complete antagonism, others show varied (synergistic, additive and/or antagonistic) interactions, thus the efficacy is dependent on the ratio in which the two components co-exist. Significance and Impact of the Study: The predominant antagonistic interactions noted here, suggests that some natural therapies containing essential oils should be used with caution when combined with antibiotics.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walker, B</author><author>Sytsma, Kenneth J</author><author>Treutlein, Jens</author><author>Wink, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SALVIA ( LAMIACEAE ) IS NOT MONOPHYLETIC : IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SYSTEMATICS , RADIATION , AND ECOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATIONS OF SALVIA AND TRIBE MENTHEAEI The genus Salvia ( tribe Mentheae , Lamiaceae ) represents an enormous and cosmopolitan assemblage of ne</title></titles><periodical/><pages>1115-1125</pages><volume>91</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>enormous and cosmopolitan assemblage</keyword><keyword>lamiaceae</keyword><keyword>mentheae</keyword><keyword>of nearly 1000 spe-</keyword><keyword>phylogenetics</keyword><keyword>rbcl</keyword><keyword>represents an</keyword><keyword>rosmiarinmis</keyword><keyword>salvia</keyword><keyword>stamen</keyword><keyword>the genus salvia</keyword><keyword>tribe mentheae</keyword><keyword>trnl-f</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Walker et al. - SALVIA ( LAMIACEAE ) IS NOT MONOPHYLETIC IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SYSTEMATICS , RADIATION , AND ECOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATIONS OF SALVIA AND TRIBE MENTHEAEI The genus Salvia ( tribe.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, M</author><author>Kikuzaki, H</author><author>Lin, C -C</author><author>Kahyaoglu, A</author><author>Huang, M -T</author><author>Nakatani, N</author><author>Ho, C -T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acetophenone glycosides from thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>1911-1914</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Acetophenone glycoside</keyword><keyword>Thyme</keyword><keyword>Thymus vulgaris L.</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Department of Food Science, Rutgers, Stt.

Thus, our aim was to investigate the influence of a thyme extract on beta(2)-receptors in competition binding experiments and relaxation experiments on rat uteri and trachea. Furthermore, the influence of the extract on respiratory clearance was of interest. Binding experiments were performed using purified rat lung membranes with the beta(2)-receptor ligand [I-125]-Cyp {[I-125]-(+/-)-lodocyanopindolol}. The transport of the fluorescence dye rhodamin 123 concerning ciliary action in the tracheal area of a mouse was investigated using a microdialysis technique. The thyme extract reduces only slightly [I-125]-CYP binding and amplifies the displacement of [I-125]-CYP by propranolol (non-specific P-receptor antagonist): the displacement curve in the concentration range representing beta(2)-receptors (nM) is shifted to the left. Thyme extract had relaxing effects on organs possessing beta(2)-receptors (uterus and trachea). The propranolol-induced antagonism to isoprenaline is reverted concentration-dependently by the extract. A duplication of the rate of ciliary clearance by the extract was ob-served. In conclusion: 1) There is evidence for an influence of a thyme extract on beta(2)-receptors by both binding studies and biological effects: As can be derived from the shift of the propranotol displacement curve (nM), ingredients of the thyme extract slightly interact with beta(2)-receptors in rat lung tissue. This effect is indirect since no full range competition curve was reached. 2) An at least indirect interaction with beta(2)-receptors in rat uteri and trachea is revealed by a decreased antagonism of propranolol on the relaxing effect of isoprenaline by the plant extract. 3) An additional mechanism is presumed because at high extract concentrations isoprenaline-induced relaxation is complete, whereas the displacement of propranolol at beta(2)-receptors is only weak. 4) Thyme extract has an indirect (modulatory) effect on the beta(2)-receptor system. 5) Mucociliary clearance is improved in vivo. Its mechanism has still to be elucidated.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Willkomm, M</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Willkomm, M</author><author>Lange, J</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Labiatae</title><secondary-title>Prodromus Florae Hispanicae</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Prodromus Florae Hispanicae</full-title></periodical><pages>389-480</pages><keywords/><dates><year>1870</year></dates><pub-location>Stuttgartiae (Stuttgart)</pub-location><publisher>Sscweizerbart E.</publisher><urls/><label>Flora;Thymus L.</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilson, J A</author><author>Isman, M B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of essential oils on toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the plant toxin thymol in the larvae of Trichoplusia ni</title><secondary-title>Canadian Entomologist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Entomologist</full-title></periodical><pages>578-589</pages><volume>138; 138</volume><issue>4; 4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>0008-347X</isbn><notes>        From Duplicate 1 (                           Influence of essential oils on toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the plant toxin thymol in the larvae of Trichoplusia ni                         - Wilson, J A; Isman, M B )

(Lamiaceae), following topical administration to the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Tested individually, trans-anethole (LD sub(50) = 71.2 mu g/larva) and methyl salicylate (93.6 mu g/larva) were the most toxic, whereas phenylethyl propionate (555.8 mu g/larva) and mineral oil (2279.3 mu g/larva) were the least toxic. However, when coadministered, mineral oil was the most synergistic (synergy ratio, SR = 25). A proprietary blend of essential oils (A4 Blend) was strongly synergistic (SR = 9), as was trans-anethole (SR = 5), while the majority of the other compounds tested yielded SRs of 2-3. Based on experiments using tritiated thymol as a radiotracer, the fate of this plant toxin within 60 min of topical administration varied widely with the essential oil carrier. Some carriers facilitated rapid disappearance of thymol from the insects' integument and rapid appearance internally, whereas others prolonged the tenure of thymol on the integument and delayed entry into the insect. The highest internal levels of radioactivity were observed when phenylethyl propionate was the carrier (47% of the topical dose), the lowest when rosemary oil was the carrier (9%). The highest proportion of the dose was excreted when eugenol was the carrier (20% of the topical dose), the lowest when mineral oil was the carrier (4%). Overall, there are no apparent trends linking the fate of thymol in the different carrier oils to the synergies observed or to the relative polarities of the carriers</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yazdani, D</author><author>Shahnazi, S</author><author>Jamshidi, A H</author><author>Rezazadeh, Sh</author><author>Mojab, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Study on variation of essential oil quality and quantity in dry and fresh herb of Thyme and Tarragon</title><secondary-title>Journal of Medicinal Plants</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Medicinal Plants</full-title></periodical><pages>7-15</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords><keyword>Artemisia dracunculus</keyword><keyword>Dry herb</keyword><keyword>Essential oil</keyword><keyword>Thymus vulgaris</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Tehran, Iran; Affiliation: Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Shaheed Beheshty University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Affiliation: Institute of Medicinal Plants, No 97, Bozorgmehr St,</pub-location><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-33746801977&amp;partnerID=40&amp;rel=R6.5.0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>Background: Thymus vulgaris L. belongs to Lamiaceae family that has 14 aromatic and perennial species, Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus L.) belongs to Asteraceae family, this genus has 34 annual and perennial species. These two species aren't self growing in Iran but are cultivated. Widely use of two species (Thyme, Tarragon) essential oils in different industries indicate that, plant water content affects on yield and constituens of essential oil. Objective: To find out the essential oil quality and quantity in dry and fresh aerial parts of Thyme and Tarragon herbs. Method: The aerial parts of Thyme and Tarragon are collected in dry and fresh from. The essential oils extracted with Clevenger set by hydrodistillation method. The yield and constituens of essential oils were determined by GC/mass. Results: No variation between yield and constituents of essential oil of Tarragon was observed in fresh and dried herb at 35°C. The essential oil yield and constituents of dried Thyme at 35°C obviously decreased as compared to fresh herb. Conclusion: The yield and constituents of essential oil of tarragon herb are same in fresh and dried form but yield of constituents and essential oil in aerial part of thyme decreased in dried form.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Youdim, K A</author><author>DamienDorman, H J</author><author>Deans, S G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The antioxidant effectiveness of thyme oil, α-tocopherol and ascorbyl palmitate on evening primrose oil oxidation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Essential Oil Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Essential Oil Research</full-title></periodical><pages>643-648</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Antioxidants</keyword><keyword>Ascorbyl palmitate</keyword><keyword>Autoxidation</keyword><keyword>Labiatae</keyword><keyword>Thyme oil</keyword><keyword>Thymus vulgaris</keyword><keyword>α-tocopherol</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Aromatic and Medicinal Plant Group, SAC Auchincruive, South Ayrshire KA6 5HW, United Kingdom</pub-location><notes>Cited By (since 1996): 9</notes><research-notes>Cited By (since 1996): 9</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-0001763680&amp;partnerID=40&amp;rel=R6.5.0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>Three antioxidants thyme oil, α-tocopherol and ascorbyl palmitate at final concentrations 250, 500, 750 and 1000 ppm, were assessed for their antioxidant effectiveness, at retarding autoxidation of evening primrose oil at 50°C for one week as measured by peroxide formation and decomposition. With respect to peroxide formation, all three antioxidants provided significant protection as compared with the control, α-tocopherol exhibiting the greatest protection between 250-750 ppm, followed by thyme oil and ascorbyl palmitate, although at 1000 ppm, thyme oil exhibited highest inhibition. Decomposition of peroxides into aldehydes was significantly reduced in the presence of all three antioxidants at all concentrations. At 250 ppm both thyme oil and α-tocopherol were significantly more effective than ascorbyl palmitate.

The gas chromatography data showed that the essential oils were rich in thymol (22-38%) and its biogenetic precursors γ-terpinene and p-cymene. The carvacrol content was relatively low in all the oils tested, ranging between 1% and 2%. The fungicidal activity of the oils was correlated with their thymol content. The principal chemical components of thyme oils were then tested using the same concentrations as in the thyme oils. Only the fungicidal activity of thymol was high and close to that of the oils with the same thymol content. The effects of the thyme oils and thymol on the hyphae cytomorphology of the studied fungi was an increased vacuolization of the cytoplasm and accumulation of lipid bodies, undulations of the plasmalemma, and alterations of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zheng, Z</author><author>Shetty, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Azo dye-mediated regulation of total phenolics and peroxidase activity in thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) clonal lines</title><secondary-title>Journal of agricultural and food chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of agricultural and food chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>932-937</pages><volume>48; 48</volume><issue>3; 3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><isbn>0021-8561</isbn><urls><web-urls><url>http://muse.lib.auth.gr:9797/com/csa/?MuseHost=www-mi2.csa.com&amp;MuseFirst=1&amp;id=2&amp;recnum=8&amp;SID=b8599c660c0d7abb640bacacd8dd54da&amp;MusePath=/ids70/view_record.php</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus vulgaris</label><abstract>Thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) clonal lines, which were previously isolated from a heterogeneous seed population by plant tissue culture techniques, have been targeted as potential plants for phytoremediation of organic pollutants such as azo dyes and related aromatic compounds. Three thyme clonal lines and three rosemary clonal lines were tested for the ability to grow on hormone-free medium containing 0.01% of azo dye Poly S-119. The results showed that dye tolerance was associated with reduced phenolics and enhanced peroxidase activity in these clonal lines. There was a clear inverse correlation between total phenolics and peroxidase activity in these plants in response to Poly S-119. The tolerance of these clonal lines showed variations at different growing stages. These observations suggested that the peroxidase activity was inducible. Because peroxidases are involved in lignification, wound healing, aromatic compound degradation, pathogen defense, and stiffening, the results suggest that azo dye stimulated the defense response of thyme and rosemary clonal plants by increasing the peroxidase activity. Stereomicroscopic observations revealed that the azo dye was sequestered within the growing axis of the plant roots, which may also enhance the polymerization of azo dye onto the cell wall with the help of enhanced peroxidase activity</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ziaková, A</author><author>Brandšteterová, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validation of HPLC determination of phenolic acids present in some Lamiaceae family plants</title><secondary-title>Journal of Liquid Chromatography and Related Technologies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Liquid Chromatography and Related Technologies</full-title></periodical><pages>443-453</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>HPLC</keyword><keyword>Phenolic acids</keyword><keyword>Plants</keyword><keyword>Validation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><pub-location>Affiliation: Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemical Technology, Slovak Technical University, Radlinskeho 9, 812 37 Bratislava, Slovakia</pub-location><notes>Cited By (since 1996): 5</notes><research-notes>Cited By (since 1996): 5</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-0037285983&amp;partnerID=40&amp;rel=R6.5.0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Thymus L.;Thymus serpyllum</label><abstract>HPLC columns with different length, particle size, and chemical properties of sorbent were tested and compared for the application in the development of the universal HPLC assay for determination of phenolic compounds, which could be present in some medicinal plants from the Lamiaceae family (Melissa officinalis, Rosmarinus officinalis, Salvia officinalis, Thymus serpyllum, and Origanum vulgare).

The major component in the studied populations was either thymol or γ-terpinene. Distinct differentiation of populations with respect to chemical composition of essential oils might be related to spatial distribution of the studied populations. No correlations between morphology, anatomy, and essential oil yield and composition were determined. Both capitate and peltate glandular trichomes were found on calyces, whereas the latter were noticed on the abaxial and adaxial leaf surface.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Καλπουτζάκης, Ε</author><author>Κωνσταντινιδης, Θ</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Φοιτος, Δ</author><author>Κωνσταντινιδης, Θ</author><author>Καμάρη, Γ</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Thymus laconicus Jalas</title><secondary-title>Βιβλίο ερυθρών δεδομένων των σπάνιων &amp; απειλούμενων φυτών της Ελλάδας</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Βιβλίο ερυθρών δεδομένων των σπάνιων &amp; απειλούμενων φυτών της Ελλάδας</full-title></periodical><pages>350</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><pub-location>Πάτρα</pub-location><publisher>Ελληνική Βοτανική Εταιρεία</publisher><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus laconicus</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Κουρέας, Δ</author><author>Κοκκίνη, Σ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Χρήση μορφομετρικών δεδομένων για την εκτίμηση της περιεκτικότητας σε αιθέριο έλαιο αυτοφυών φυτών του γένους Thymus L.</title><secondary-title>12ο Πανελλήνιο Επιστημονικό Συνέδριο Ελληνικής Βοτανικής Εταιρείας</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>12ο Πανελλήνιο Επιστημονικό Συνέδριο Ελληνικής Βοτανικής Εταιρείας</full-title></periodical><volume>Ρέθυμνο</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>Ρέθυμνο</pub-location><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus sibthorpii</label><abstract>Τα φυτά του γένους Thymus L. κατέχουν μία σημαντική θέση στην παγκόσμια αγορά φαρμακευτικών και αρωματικών φυτών λόγω των Αιθερίων Ελαίων (AE) τους. Οι διεθνείς, ευρωπαϊκές και εθνικές προδιαγραφές για τον έλεγχο της ποιότητας των φυτών που διακινούνται εμπορικά ως «thyme» (θυμάρι) περιλαμβάνουν, μεταξύ άλλων, τον προσδιορισμό της ελάχιστης περιεκτικότητας σε ΑΕ (mL 100g-1 ξηρού βάρους). Στην παρούσα εργασία επιχειρήθηκε ο προσδιορισμός της περιεκτικότητας σε ΑΕ αυτοφυών φυτών του είδους Th. sibthorpii Benth. με τη χρήση μορφομετρίας. Η σύγκριση μορφομετρικών δεδομένων με τα αποτελέσματα που προέκυψαν από την παραλαβή των ΑΕ με τη μέθοδο της υδρο-απόσταξης έδειξε ότι η περιεκτικότητα σε ΑΕ ενός φυτικού ατόμου μπορεί να εκτιμηθεί με βάση τον αριθμό και τη διάμετρο των αδενικών λεπίων της επιφάνειας των φύλλων του.</abstract></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Κουρέας, Δ</author><author>Κοκκίνη, Σ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Η ονοματολογική ιστορία του «θυμαριού»: Από τον Διοσκορίδη στον Λινναίο και τη σύγχρονη εποχή</title><secondary-title>11ο Πανελλήνιο Επιστημονικό Συνέδριο Ελληνικής Βοτανικής Εταιρείας</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>11ο Πανελλήνιο Επιστημονικό Συνέδριο Ελληνικής Βοτανικής Εταιρείας</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><pub-location>Αθήνα</pub-location><publisher>Ελληνική Βοτανική Εταιρεία</publisher><urls/><label>Thyme;Thymus L.</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Κρίγκας, Ν</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Φοιτος, Δ</author><author>Κωνσταντινιδης, Θ</author><author>Καμάρη, Γ</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Thymus plasonii Adamov.</title><secondary-title>Βιβλίο ερυθρών δεδομένων των σπάνιων &amp; απειλούμενων φυτών της Ελλάδας</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Βιβλίο ερυθρών δεδομένων των σπάνιων &amp; απειλούμενων φυτών της Ελλάδας</full-title></periodical><pages>353</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><pub-location>Πάτρα</pub-location><publisher>Ελληνική Βοτανική Εταιρεία</publisher><urls/><label>Thymus L.;Thymus plasonii</label></record><record><database name="Thymus L export.enl" path="Thymus L export.enl">Thymus L export.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Κωνσταντινιδης, Θ</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Φοιτος, Δ</author><author>Κωνσταντινιδης, Θ</author><author>Καμάρη, Γ</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Thymus hartvigii R.

Scratchpads 2.x
===============

1. Overview
-----------
Scratchpads are an online virtual research environment for biodiversity, 
allowing anyone to share their data and create their own research networks. 
Sites are hosted at the Natural History Museum London, and offered freely to 
any scientist that completes an online [registration 
form](http://get.scratchpads.eu).

Sites can focus on specific taxonomic groups, or the biodiversity of a 
biogeographic region, or indeed any aspect of natural history. Scratchpads are 
also suitable for societies or for managing and presenting projects. Key 
features of Scratchpads (see also Scratchpads feature list) include: tools to 
manage biological classifications, bibliography management, media (images, 
video and audio), rich taxon pages (with structured descriptions, specimen 
records, and distribution data), and character matrices.

Scratchpads support various ways of communicating with site members and 
visitors such as blogs, forums, newsletters and a commenting system.

2. Installation
---------------
The Scratchpads are based upon [Drupal](http://drupal.org/), and therefore have 
many of the same dependencies as it does. We recommend installing Scratchpads 
using [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) only, preferably on a Debian based server. 
We are currently working on a Vagrant/Chef setup to allow users to get their 
own copy of the Scratchpads up and running easily. We expect this to be ready 
by July 2015.
